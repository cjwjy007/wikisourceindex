 | notes      = ''The '''Constitution for the United States of America''' is the supreme law of the United States of America. It was completed on September 17, 1787, with its adoption by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was later ratified by special conventions in each state. It created a federal union of sovereign states, and a federal government to operate that union. It replaced the less defined union that had existed under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. It took effect on March 4, 1789 and has served as a model for the constitutions of numerous other nations. The Constitution of the United States of America is the oldest written national constitution in use.''

The Constitution is the second of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], with [[Additional amendments to the United States Constitution|later amendments]]. This edition is taken from the [http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html US House of Representatives web site].

[[File:Israel Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|The original document of Israel's Declaration of Independence]]
[[w:Eretz-Israel|The Land of Israel]] was the birthplace of the [[w:Jew|Jewish people]]. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal [[Bible|Book of Books]].

After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.

Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses. Pioneers, defiant returnees, and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the [[w:Hebrew language|Hebrew language]], built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood.

In the year 5657 (1897), at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, [[w:Theodor Herzl|Theodore Herzl]], the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country.

This right was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration]] of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Eretz-Israel and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.

The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people - the [[w:Holocaust|massacre of millions of Jews in Europe]] - was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the community of nations.

Survivors of the [[w:Nazism|Nazi]] holocaust in Europe, as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Eretz-Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland.

In the [[w:World War II|Second World War]], the Jewish community of this country contributed its full share to the struggle of the freedom- and peace-loving nations against the forces of Nazi wickedness and, by the blood of its soldiers and its war effort, gained the right to be reckoned among the peoples who founded the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]].

On the 29th November, 1947, the United Nations [[w:UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel; the General Assembly required the inhabitants of Eretz-Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their State is irrevocable.

This right is the natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.

Thus members and representatives of the Jews of Palestine and of the [[w:Zionism|Zionist]] movement are here assembled on the day is the termination of the British Mandate over Eretz-Yisra'el and, by virtue of our natural and historic right and on the strength of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, '''HEREBY DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ-YISRAEL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL.'''

'''WE DECLARE''' that, with effect from the moment of the termination of the Mandate being tonight, the eve of Sabbath, the 6th Iyar, 5708 (15th May, 1948), until the establishment of the elected, regular authorities of the State in accordance with the Constitution which shall be adopted by the Elected Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October 1948, the People's Council shall act as a Provisional Council of State, and its executive organ, the People's Administration, shall be the Provisional Government of the Jewish State, to be called '''&quot;[[w:Israel|The State of Israel]]&quot;'''.

'''THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles'''; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

'''THE STATE OF ISRAEL is prepared to cooperate with the agencies and representatives of the United Nations''' in implementing the resolution of the General Assembly of the 29th November, 1947, and will take steps to bring about the economic union of the whole of Eretz-Israel.

'''WE APPEAL to the United Nations''' to assist the Jewish people in the building-up of its State and to receive the State of Israel into the community of nations.

'''WE APPEAL - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.'''

'''WE EXTEND our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land.''' The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire [[w:Middle East|Middle East]].

'''WE APPEAL to the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora to rally round the Jews of Eretz-Israel''' in the tasks of immigration and upbuilding and to stand by them in the great struggle for the realization of the age-old dream - the redemption of Israel.

'''PLACING OUR TRUST IN THE STRENGTH OF ISRAEL'''*, WE AFFIX OUR SIGNATURES TO THIS PROCLAMATION AT THIS SESSION OF THE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE, ON THE SOIL OF THE HOMELAND, IN THE CITY OF TEL-AVIV, ON THIS SABBATH EVE, THE 5TH DAY OF IYAR, 5708 (14TH MAY, 1948).

* '''Published in the Official Gazette, No. 1 of the 5th, Iyar, 5708 (14th May, 1948)'''

* ''Translator's Note:'' '''* The Strength of Israel (Hebrew: צור ישראל ''tzur yisra'el'', Lit. &quot;The Rock of Israel&quot; or &quot;The Fortress of Israel&quot;)''' - Also one of God's titles. The ambiguity in selecting this term was intentional. [Ami Isseroff adds - Literally it means &quot;Rock of Israel.&quot; According to Tom Segev in ''The first Israelis'' the term was selected to satisfy the demand of religious party representative Moshe Shapira, that &quot;the Lord of Israel&quot; must be mentioned in the declaration, while at the same time satisfying the objection of the leftist MAPAM party that &quot;the Lord of Israel&quot; must not be mentioned in the declaration. Ben Gurion said he could go along with that formulation, allowing the declaration to be approved before the Sabbath and before the British left the country.

 | title    = If—
 | author   = Rudyard Kipling
 | section  =
 | previous =
 | next     =
 | year = 1910
 | notes    = '''''If—''' is a notable poem by Rudyard Kipling. It was written in 1895; the poem was first published in the Brother Square Toes chapter of Rewards and Fairies, Kipling's 1910 collection of short stories and poems. Like [[Author:William Ernest Henley|William Ernest Henley]]'s [[Invictus]], it is a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism and the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; that popular culture has made into a traditional British virtue. Its status is both confirmed by the number of parodies it has inspired, and by the widespread popularity it still draws amongst Britons (it was voted Britain's favourite poem in a 1995 BBC opinion poll).''

''According to Kipling in his autobiography Something of Myself (1937), the poem was inspired by Dr Leander Starr Jameson, who in 1895 led a raid by British forces against the Boers in South Africa, subsequently called the Jameson Raid. This defeat increased the tensions that ultimately led to the Second Boer War. The British press, however, portrayed Jameson as a hero in the middle of the disaster, and the actual defeat as a British victory.''

&lt;poem&gt;
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot;

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Name of the project ==
Hey - I thought that the name of this project was going to be Wikisource. I own http://wikisource.org and http://wikisource.com and in the meantime will redirect those domain names here. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 06:08, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I agree. I'd been calling it Wikisource too and I'm not keen on &quot;Project Sourceberg&quot;, but that can be fixed either through the languages.php or with the new MediaWiki namespace when it is introduced. I imagine that moving it to wikisource.org wouldn't be too difficult either. I'll lave a message for Brion about it. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 07:45, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::I thought that there would be something like {languagecode}.wikisource.org? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 20:41, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::You mean, this isn't the Wikiberg project? &lt;smiles&gt; But still: If the other parts are anything to go by, it should be should be Wiki-something. I'm not sure &quot;source&quot; is right, though. Apart from the software associations the word has on the net, the implication is that one has drawn information from it. That is, an older work is only a source for a work it is used for. All other documents appear in the bibliography. Is this the intented use? (We may need a &quot;What Wikiberg &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; page.) [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 00:19, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)ccc

Wait, *wait!* This project's name should be SourceWiki, to collate automatically with every other source-related reference in people's bookmarks, favorites and lists. This is done naturally alphabetically by the first word, so that should be &quot;source.&quot; &quot;Source&quot; is the topic--people are thinking of seeing available Source text in various books, etc. Other wiki's, e.g. WardWiki, are like this. The name should not align with Wikipedia, possibly chosen to resonate with &quot;Encyclopedia.&quot; &quot;Wiki&quot; suits the water people swim in (the medium they use reflexively) better than the water they drink (&quot;I think I'll have a &quot;wiki!&quot;).

The site can stay at wikisource.org if desired. [[oldwikisource:User:Georgesawyer|Georgesawyer]] 22:49, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I'm glad that you are not going to insist that we change direction, and that we don't need to change 36,000 articles.  I can now relax with a good stiff Scotch and Wiki. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 04:55, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
----

== Aim of the project ==
Perhaps we already need a [[oldwikisource:What Wikisource is not]] page.  It's very new, and all discussion that I have seen about it envision it as a place for original sources.  This does not qualify it as a dumping ground for lists that some people don't want on Wikipedia.  If the lists of ZIP codes and saints are to have any value they need to stay on Wikipedia where they can be linked to the items in that list. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:18, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I definitely miss the article of [[oldwikisource:What Wikisource is]] and any other pages which tell what kind of texts are to be included here (and what not), what is a ''source''; and give a definitive and obvious place to talk about it and shape its definitions if necessary.

:For example I still have an idio^H^H^H^Hguy who is annoying us on ''HU'' that he wants to create articles about fictional things (like ''Webcone'' or the definition of ''Unarticulable future'', among other proprietary nonsense). Is wikisource is the media for him to publish his fictional ecyclopaedic material? (GFDL) (We definitely do not welcome these on the &quot;real&quot; wikipedia.) --[[oldwikisource:User:Grin|grin]] 12:19, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)
::You make a very good point.  Describing what something is not does depend a lot on what it is.  I'll pay some attention to starting a page of that sort. (I've removed the ''sp?'' from your comments; the word is correct.)
::The idiot that you describe is not uniquely Hungarian.  They exist for all languages.  I don't see Wikisource as the place for the kind of material you describe any more than Wikipedia.  I mostly see Wikisource as a series of reference texts which have usually been published somewhere else.  These texts can also include tabular material or other statistical data.  It is not a place for Wikipedians to publish books that no sane publisher would accept.  All of us would be happy to have thes fools go to somebody else's project.  In some senses Meta was devised to divert thes people, but perhaps they need their own project as a sort of asylum where they can be safely ignored. ;-) [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:37, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::: Although this is somewhat different, I've long thought it would be nice for there to be a &quot;dream wiki&quot; where people could create wishlists for inventions, software (both those which compare features on existing products as well as what an idealized product would be able to do), as well as an arts clearinghouse for artistic ideas (e.g., film or literature concepts) which could be shared for others to develop further, or even proposed solutions to political and social problems.  The reason I think these would be ideal for wiki format is that people could have a centralized place to find out what has been envisioned on a given topic, and even give opportunities for innovation and possibly collaboration.  Although things might get unclear where opinions could seem inherently conflicting, the primary aim would not be to delete ideas, but to organize them by topic.  This would in my view also ideally be subtly linked from Wikipedia for those wishing to find the corresponding innovation/ideas page for a given topic under research as it could be of interest to the researcher. [[oldwikisource:User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 04:20, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Have you guys heard of project Gutenberg? How do your aims differ from theirs? There seems to be alot of overlap.  Maybe you could integrate your efforts? - Steve

:This has been discussed earlier, see [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Wikisource and Project Gutenberg]]. You are welcome to comment further on that page, if you feel that you have something to add to the discussion :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Christian S|Christian S]] 17:29, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

What about music texts?  I'd like a repository of scores (pdf perhaps).  Is there a category for this, or another wiki, or can we make one? -- Geoff

== Languages ==
Is this like Meta, one Wiki but offical many languages. Or like Wiktionary; only English for now. For other languages there must be setup new wiki's? [[oldwikisource:User:Walter|Walter]] 08:54, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I still don't think there is a enough meat to this project for it to be an interesting and viable place. Why is it necessary to edit public domain texts from projects like Distributed Proofreaders?

::: &quot;It would be very dumb&quot; to have it like meta. All languages should be welcome, but like in Wikipedia it does not make much sense to intersperse Malayan en Gaelic documents.

The reason why Wikipedia is so segmented is because of naming conflicts. Articles on Albert Einstein will require that exact same title is a great many languages. Sources will be given their original title names; whatever that language is. If there happens to be a public domain translation, then that translated title would be the page name.

Then anons visiting a page with a language category tag set to &quot;French&quot; will have his or her interface language change to French.

== Everything moved from ps. ==

I probably should have clarified this yesterday, but all that happened last night is that ''all'' the articles from ps.wikipedia were moved here. This was done to clean up what ought to be Pashto Wikipedia. The movement of them here did not involve any editorial decisions and it does not reflect a view that those articles should stay here. It was just easier to get them moved in one go. Later, when we have some policies here, we can decide what needs to be done with them. Most of them have not been edited since their move here, so they all need work, if not deletion.

:Right! It wouldn't do to have the Afghans angry with us.
:There are a number of things which need to be decided - [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is not]] is probably a good place to start. We also need to decide whether to stick with the name Project Sourceberg, or to go with Wikisource (or WikiSource) or something else entirely. I was assuming it was international and we already have articles in Latin, Polish, French and German, but that decision is another one which will need to be made. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 19:24, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The Project Sourceberg/Wikisource naming issue should be at the top of the list, before the project gets so big that a change will imply moving a lot more articles.  I very much favour the latter name as consistent with the naming conventions used on other projects.  That consistent approach will help the public to associate any &quot;wiki-xxx&quot; with the wikimedia.  Perhaps even the 9/11 project could be changed to &quot;wikimorial&quot; to leave it room to evolve into something that also honours victims of other tragedies. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 21:28, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)----

::: Agreed on priority and on the wikimorial idea, though I'm not sure about the &quot;morial&quot; bit. Alternatives? And who will have to be persuaded?) As mentioned before, I'm not sure about &quot;source&quot;. Since the open bit is already implied in &quot;wiki&quot;, can we simply be &quot;wikitext(s)&quot;? Unless we take pictures too, in which case we'd be &quot;wikimedia&quot;. Oops! [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 00:19, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::Ditto Ec. I kinda like the &quot;Wikimorial&quot; name - at least as a working title. However beware of Working titles! &quot;Wikibooks&quot; was a working title that stuck. I would have liked &quot;Wikiveristy&quot; better (I also don't think that &quot;Wikibooks&quot; is a trademarkable name - there are many uses of that term prior to the project's founding). So it is best to have unique names. Wikisource and Wikimorial fit that bill.  --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

== Links ? ==

Another thing that should be decided is whether this project is wanted at all. People may well have been bugging Brion for it, but on the other hand, there are still a lot of people arguing that this stuff should be on Wikipedia. The Polish Wikipedia have created a new namespace for source texts. If people are going to oppose the movement of source texts from Wikipedia to here (which they are doing at en), how is it going to work? Or should the [[en:WP:WWIN|Wikipedia is not a repository for source texts]] rule just be more strictly imposed? [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 10:49, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Speeches ==

==Multi language front page ==
Though this page has become the general (English) discussion page, this is also where I land when trying to comment explicitely on the main page:
Should the main page be single-language until we know what this Wiki will be? This would give meta-wiki the time to sort out the Wikipedia front page issue. [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 04:42, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I think it's necessary to make the main page an index as Wikipedia does, i can hardly image when the current main page growing longer and longer! --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 10:08, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:I agree.  There has been talk at Wikipedia for some time now about introducing a category scheme which can hopefully also be adapted to this project.  A table of contents is another thing, and is probably what you meant.  The entire project will indeed become unworkable if links to every entry are on the Main Page.  The primary link will be the one created by the contributor when he begins his contribution.  This needs to be an idiot-proof system that virtually guarantees that the entry will be linked from the right place.  In some ways this is made easier by the fact that there for the immediately forseeable future, each individual contribution will have fewer links though that too will change when interwiki links are more functional.  It is made more complicated and challenging by the decision (which I accept) that there should be a single multi-language wikisource project. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 19:22, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)
----

== Page Titles ==

The naming of pages is an issue that must be addressed soon. I added 3 essays with the authors name followed by a dash and then the essay title, but now think that perhaps just the title should be used until actual conflicts arise, and then have the title followed by the authors name, or have the title followed by the author on all compositions.  I am refraining from further additions for now, and await others ideas on the matter. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] 13:12, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I see someone else has added essays with title followed by author, and I do believe this probably is the best format for all literary works and speeches. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] 13:22, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Isn't that what's doing in English Wikipedia? Unless there are some texts having the same names, we have no need to use title like '''NAME:TITLE''' IMHO. Using '''TITLE (NAME)''' would be a good idea to disambiguate the two texts with the same names. And, disambiguation pages are needed sometimes. --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:40, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)
I agree to the principal entry being under the title with the author being used in the title in cases where it is necessary for disambiguation or to expand generic titles such as Poetry of ..., Essays of ..., etc. which tend to be inherently ambiguous.  A further language indicator may be needed when we have the work in several languages.  The absence of a language indicator woould tell us that the work is in its original language.

The main English page, and those for other languages, now have links to articles in that language based on a ''prima facie'' division of categories.  I think that we can easily agree that this will very soon outgrow the main page.  The Main Page should then have links to broad entry reference pages.  Ultimately every substantive contribution '''must''' link through or be traceable to one of these pages.  The first that I would want to establish is [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Authors]] for all works attributable to a personal author.  A primary division of this first level listing by genres is not helpful.  Some authors used several genres, and it is most helpful to put an authors works together in one place.  Sometimes a user may simply not be aware that a famous work is in a genre other than what he might expect.  The ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey&quot; were written in verse, but many may only be familiar with prose translations of these works.  Other top level categories will soon be evident.  I hope to say more as my ideas develop. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 02:58, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Poetry==

It would perhaps be best to create pages for each Author and only afterwards, if necessary, create seperate pages for longer works. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] ]

:I agree, and sometimes maybe we need to create separate pages for each chapter! (using slash) :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:33, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Classical Texts==

I'm very new at this whole thing, and I hope I haven't misunderstood the whole purpose of this project.  But still, I was surprised that on the Main Page here there was no category for &quot;Classical Texts.&quot;  This is what I initially thought the whole project was about: allowing people to write introductions and commentaries to texts, to provide study aids, etc.  And perhaps most important of all, for primary texts that are English translations from classical languages such as Greek, Hebrew, Latin - to allow for the free update of what are largely outdated public domain translations.

Examples: Homer; classical philosophy (e.g. Aristotle), etc.

If people agree with what I've written here, then perhaps we can add a &quot;classical texts&quot; category.[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 07:20, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Yes, definitely - add it. The project only started a few days ago which is why they aren't there yet. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 08:21, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

OK, then I'll add it.  Maybe actually in three categories:
Ancient and Classical Texts
Medieval Texts
Early Modern Texts

Would people agree to this?[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 13:41, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Wikibooks is where study aids and annotations go. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 19:16, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Wikibooks, if I understand correctly, is for ''schoolbooks'', i.e. for textbooks and for the kinds of literary texts that everybody has to buy and read in high school or college.  So Shakespeare belongs there too, because it is required reading.  And maybe other things that are often on teachers' reading lists, or for which there are Cliff notes.  But most other texts ''don't'' belong there, they belong here (again, if I have understood correctly).

How have other people understood this issue?[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 11:29, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Yep. Although Wikibooks aims to add value to Shakespeare by adding annotation. In the future it would be real nice to be able to export the content of Wikisource's version of Shakespeare's works to Wikibooks. We already do something similar for the Wikimedia Foundation website (the source file for http://wikimediafoundation.org/fundraising is at [[meta:Wikimedia_Fundraising_page]]). That way Wikisource can concentrate on providing authoritative sources and Wikibooks can concentrate on annotating educationally significant sources (along with creating study guides and textbooks). --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 18:20, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I think I got it. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 12:46, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

If I would change something in the PD-editions of Latin texts (e.g. M. (Marcus) in stead of M'. (Manius), which is now generally accepted as correction of the Annals of Tacitus) would this violate the copyright of the authors who proposed this correction (in this case R. Syme)? Because I have mentioned in my dutch translation of the Annales references to some works that helped me with my translation([[oldwikisource:Nederlandse vertaling van de Annales#Verantwoording vertaling|1]]). It would be handy if the PD-texts can be &quot;updated&quot; to the modern interpretation of the text.--[[oldwikisource:User:Evil berry|Evil berry]]

==Top level category for treaties etc.==
I suggest a general category of &quot;Special Documents&quot; for what is now: Treaties, Pacts, Legal Texts, and Declarations.  Also: I think &quot;Essays&quot; is too general, already covered in other categories.[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 14:48, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I will follow what you suggest, I am not an expert in this domain. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 15:03, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I've been puzzling over this one myself.  &quot;Special&quot; seems too general, since there are many ways to be special.  My current thinking tends toward &quot;Historic documents&quot;, but I don't feel completely firm about this.  The one thing now there which I feel does not belong is the Eurovision song material which has dubious importance beside all the others.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:27, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I've done a bit more restructuring for the approach to linkage on the Main English Page.  The left half gives primary categories, and in theory every source document in Wikisource should be able to link back to the main page through one of these categories.  They have also been put into a logical order based on a series of questions in the form &quot;Does it belong here? If not go to the next question.&quot;  The final category is &quot;none of the above&quot;, which is also a default category.  Other categories may be added later when the need arises.  I still need to break off pages for some of the categories.

The right half I've called &quot;secondary indexes&quot;.  Inclusion in any of these is optional.  I don't expect to work on the remaining items here until I've finished with the left side. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 00:04, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I agree, '''Treaties''' needs to be a major category. There are a rather lot of them, and they are quite large. I would then propose that the rest be called something like '''Documents of Governance''' being laws, constitutions and court rulings. (Humm, maybe '''Court Rulings''' would need to be a major heading someday too.)  [[[[oldwikisource:User:PaulinSaudi|PaulinSaudi]] 17:14, 1 May 2004 (UTC)]]

One of the things that I'm trying to avoid is too many top level primary categories; several that are already there should probably be moved away from there.  The reasonable argument about &quot;Treaties&quot; could be made about a lot of other things with the result that the Main Page would soon become unwieldy.  Historical documents (though a different comprehensive name could possibly be found) covers a broad range of texts, and &quot;Treaties&quot; is best treated as a sub-heading from there. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 17:44, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

==Link to Wikipedia Main Page==

Does anyone know why this English Main Page for WikiSource is ''not'' linked to the English Wikipedia Main Page?  (Under &quot;Sister Projects&quot;).  Is it possible to put it there?  (I know the Main Page is only supposed to be touched very carefully...)[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 04:31, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I did suggest it at [[:en:talk:Main Page]] and got no reply. I shall take no reply to be agreement and try adding it. :) [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 22:17, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Please Note Translations ==

There's currently quite a few documents here not in the language they were written in.  These don't count in their own right as primary source document, but are instead ''translations'' of primary source documents.  Thus, they should be labeled as such, and the translator should preferably be noted (and whether the translation is an official one or not).  The [[oldwikisource:Constitution des États-Unis d'Amérique|French version of the US Constitution]] and the [[oldwikisource:The Constitution of Japan 1946|English version of the Japanese Constitution]] are two good examples.  This has two purposes: it lets people know whether a translation is ''the'' translation, or just ''a'' translation, and it lets people know that the document isn't really a primary source text in its own right. --[[oldwikisource:User:Delirium|Delirium]] 03:08, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:There's a question or whether texts translated by 'us' belong here, even with a note.  Perhaps they belong on Wikibooks in some form.  Personally, I think they should belong here, appropriately noted as you say.  This definitely needs to be clarified in [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is not]] or [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is]] once it's been decided.  --[[oldwikisource:User:Spikey|Spikey]] 13:50, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I have no problem with having translations of works in this project, though equally strong cases could be made for having these at Wikibooks.  My primary delineation between the two projects is that this one is for the works themselves, while Wikibooks is '''about''' the works.

We will probably have a lot of cases where the work that appears at Wikisource is not here in the original language.  As long as the fact is clearly stated that should be fine; the original can be added later.  Having the Gandhi works appear in the original Gujarati alone wouldn't help many people.  My own work on a master index has been with the distinction between originals firmly in mind.  I agree that the names of who translated something should be recorded, and if a translation is an original one by a Wikimedian that two should be recorded. An original translation by default would be subject to GFDL.  Translations are derivative works for copyright purposes, and there are many instances where the original is in the public domain, but the translation is not.

The reference to the American and Japanese constitutions is interesting.  These are only official in the languages of those countries.  No translation of them has official status; there is no such thing as '''the''' translation. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:20, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I believe that this translation comes from http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/funddocs/constfr.htm, so I would see it as an offical translation. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 10:37, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:It may be an excellent translation from a reliable source, but that still does not make it &quot;official&quot; for legal purposes.

Well, it is not a [[Wikipedia:protected page|protected page]] and this is a [[Wikipedia:wiki|wiki]] after all, meaning that there is no need to discuss changes before performing them. By the way, I don't know why do you think I'm doing it to suit myself, after all, I'm giving it a more user-friendly, easy-to-access and live environment similar to [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia's Main Page]]. Peace out, --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 22:06, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:If you want we could place a vote for the different styles, I think that's the best approach. :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 22:25, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Of course it's not a protected page, and I certainly would not support that it become a protected page in the near future.  The Wikipedia main page has been protected because it was attracting a lot of common vandals; this was making life difficult for everybody.  The simple fact that a page is not protected is not alone a valid excuse for doing something to the page that would totally change its character.  So yes you can edit it the way you want, but then so can anybody else.  That's what edit wars are made of.

There may be no adopted rule that requires discussing a change before performing it, but doing so can be a breach of Wikiquette, especially when the page in question is fundamental to the overall operation to a major part of the project.  Whether your changes made the page more user-friendly and easier to access is debatable, and I don't know what you mean by &quot;live environment&quot;.

As for votes, no thanks!  Votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions.  It prevents alternative third solutions.  If you were more willing to express what is important to you in those changes, a compromise might more easily be reached.  Not all aspects of that page are equally important to me.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 09:24, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: As you have stated yourself, &quot;the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions&quot;. I beleive that it is completely unnecessary to move the discussion here.

: To tell you the truth, I don't understand why _you_ don't like the changes. I'm kinda tired of this childish feeling that I have by playing Sherlock Holmes with you; trying to guess out what you don't like. Right now it looks like you are circumvilating the debate, instead of attacking it already. Maybe you could be more specific and to the point? please pretty sir? :)

: You see, if you don't like a change, you should at least provide a reason of why you don't like it. Stating that you are reverting it because it is an &quot;undiscussed change&quot; or because you are &quot;restoring primary categories&quot; (when they were never removed) is kinda vague. Which, btw, makes it hard to adjust it in order to be gratifying.

: Let me try to guess what you may be looking for... *sigh* *deep breath*

&lt;blockquote&gt;

* Index: obvious &amp; easy-to-access menu that should be at the very top of the page, right after the introduction.

* New texts: providing a living environment to the page.
** By living I mean something with a constant internal change, but with an external layout that remains the same &amp;mdash; think of the human body or the Wikipedia Main Page (especifically the &quot;Selected Articles&quot; section).

* Quick Reference Help: just a layout change, the text pretty much remains the same.
** I don't know why it is titled &quot;Primary Categories&quot; when it is indeed a &quot;Quick Reference Help&quot; (similar to Windows's Help).

* Community: providing quick reference help pages just like in the Wikipedia Main Page.

I did not express that this was a debate between two users.  I said, &quot;Votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions.&quot;  Perhaps I should rephrase it to &quot;Votes stifle consensus by reducing the entire debate to two opposing position.&quot;  This is not just a matter affecting two users, but one affecting everybody's relation to the project (or at least to its English part).  Putting it on personal talk pages means that fewer people will see it.  I have nothing to hide in my views.

Yes Ashley did express preference to your version as it was at the time.  My comments at the time referred only to the &quot;coloured bullets&quot;, which I was happy to see all black.

My main concern on this page is the &quot;primary categories&quot; which I view as the top end of a site map.  I don't at all see how it can be analogous to a &quot;Windows Help&quot; page.  I would say the same thing about it as you do about the Index: &quot;obvious &amp; easy-to-access menu that should be at the very top of the page, right after the introduction.&quot;

I mostly do not touch what is now called the &quot;Index&quot;.  Its maintenance is irregular, and its divisions are subjective.  Neverthess I avoid interfering with what people put there.

There is very little dispute about the contents of &quot;New Texts&quot; and &quot;Quick Reference Help / Community&quot;, although we may differ about their relative placements on the page.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 20:42, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

PS: You are evidently more comfortable with the use of HTML than I.  If some agreement can be reached, implementing it may be easier for you.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 21:07, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: Ahhh.. so that's it. Ok, how about this: we can set the index and the quick reference help at the top. For example, check out [[oldwikisource:Main Page:Espanol]]. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the case of [[oldwikisource:Main Page:Espanol]] you would like the &quot;Primary Categories&quot; where &quot;Textos Nuevos&quot; is located? Give me some time, I'm on Linux right now and don't have my tools here. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 00:34, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Not exactly, but close.  I would switch the positions of &quot;Indice&quot; and &quot;Primary Categories.  &quot;Textos Nuevos&quot; y &quot;Communidad&quot; would be fine where you have them. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 02:07, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== New format ==
''Part of the original discussion was moved to [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium]].''

Please check out the new format of the main page in English. Btw, if we set the table width to &quot;100%&quot;, that's would be too wide; 80% is appropriate. --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:51, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I've switched places between &quot;Primary Categories&quot; and &quot;Other Indexes&quot;.  Read the &quot;Top Level Category...&quot; section above for the rationale of what I'm trying to do.  I think that the headings in what has been called &quot;Index&quot; are not designed to be comprehensive.  I think that the index section can be useful for creating a lot of different specialized indexes.  I also found that reducing the overall width to 80% made the half-width sections too narrow. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 07:49, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:In terms of &quot;different specialized indexes&quot; I just moved stuff up one level. (This is much more useful than just &quot;Texts&quot; and it can help new viewers get a sense of the broad, vast potential of a great site like this.)  In general, I think the new Mainpage is really nice, both visually and in terms of usefulness.  Those who worked on it did a great job.--[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 07:52, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: &lt;hr&gt;

: Tables are usually set to a full width (100%) because there are users who browse in low screen resolutions. For example, it may seem huge for someone running under 1600x1200, but for those running on 800x600, setting the width to 80% takes away a considerable amount of screen space.

: Just FYI, so that you understand the reasoning behind it: college students that use computers that are property of the campus, browse at a 800x600 resolution usually. 1600x1200 is rare (I think the last stadistic was 5%). A few years ago, the common resolution was 640x480, now it is 800x600; with 1024x768 as the next &quot;standard&quot; (at its pace, it will be the most common in less than 2 years probably).

==Consensus format of [[oldwikisource:Main Page:English]]==

Well, I think we finally got it all resolved. HOORJ! ^_^ --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 02:46, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:Great!  I hope Samuel will agree.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 03:34, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::it looks nice. :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 01:48, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)

==Updating==
A while back it was agreed that we should have &quot;New texts&quot; links as part of the main page.  It would be nice if the proponents of that feature made an effort to maintain it. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 05:18, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Licenses==

I have an idea for a new category: &quot;Licenses&quot;.  This category could contain the GFDL, GPL, Lesser GPL, FreeBSD License, and Microsoft's EULA, etc.  Good idea?  Bad idea?  Am I completely insane? [[oldwikisource:User:Supadawg|Supadawg]] 00:56, 6 May 2004 (UTC)


That actually seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure if licenses themselves are copyrighted. Off course, the GPL isn't, but I'm not to sure on the MS EULA. If licenses allow it, great idea. It could be used for all sorts of comparison and research. --[[oldwikisource:User:80.57.134.174|80.57.134.174]] 10:42, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Primary Categories Section ==

This should not be in question/answer form with a section for each question, it just ends up repeating the same phrase over and over, and overcompicating the view of the front page.  Probably would look nicer delimited by &quot;--&quot; like in wikipedia, or just as a bulleted list.

As a side note, it might be nice to add a &quot;Featured text&quot; or something to make good use of the front page, while still linking to the categories.

[[oldwikisource:User:Siroxo|Siroxo]] 02:13, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Mathematical Vs. Numerical ==

I think it is misleading that the question asks whether is mathematical when really it is referring to being numerical. I think the page should be changed to numerical rather than mathematical. For example, I don't think Euclid's elements would fall under that category even though it may be purely mathematical.
--[[oldwikisource:User:Cronian|Cronian]] 06:23, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:I understand your point.  What I like about &quot;mathematical&quot; is that it is a broader term, despite the fact that the subject has been dominated by numerical charts and tables.  Tables of integrals are a conceivable inclusion.  Euclid's elements would likely have been included under the author. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:01, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Public Patents? ==

I wouldn't myself be inclined to develop these pages (as I'd have no idea what to do about it), but I noticed that the category of public patents (if such things exist, as I have heard they do), would be a nice, logical addition to this site and set of sites. [[oldwikisource:User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 04:09, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:Including the material available should be a fine afternoon's work.  The USPTO has all this on line, and it's only 4 terabytes long.  It is still missing the material that was lost in the fire of 1836-12-15.  See http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 00:13, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:: I wasn't sure if you understand that by public patents I was referring to patents which were kind of anti-patents or GPL-type of things for inventions.  By the way, Eclecticology, did you see my response to your older posting in section 2 above? [[oldwikisource:User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 06:38, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:::Thanks for pointing out your earlier comments; I had not noticed them before.  Your idea is certainly interesting and with tremendous possibilities.  Admittedly life on the Wiki has made me far more familiar with copyright law than with patent law.  Perhaps too the fact that I recently acquired the book, ''the smoking gun'' may have put me in an unfair mood.  It mentions such things as U.S. Patent 5,472,399, &quot;An apparatus for exercising the penis&quot;, and Patent 5,934,226, &quot;A diaper for pet birds&quot;.

:::I have no problem supporting the principle that you express; it is certainly visionary.  I still don't know what the right wiki project would be for it, but ultimately, once it gets off the ground, it would deserve a project of its own. I have always maintained that the public domain signifies not an absence of ownership, but an ownership by the public.  Patents have a much shorter lifespan than copyritghts.  Henson's 1842 patent of the airfoil was well into the public domain but the time the Wright Brothers were ready for their first flight.  I guess my point with that is that a free patent regime depends far more on what has gone before than is the case with open copyrights.  Patents need to be reviewed before being granted, and, at least in theory, that includes checking to see if the idea duplicates a previously patented idea.  I think that there is a lot of room for challenging some patents, but unless the challenger personally has a vested interest it just won't happen.  Would the previous invention of a poop bag for dogs have prevented the patent of the bird diaper that I mentioned. Also, the fact that something is patented does not prevent you from using the description to make a model for your own use; it only prevents you from marketting the product and using it to derive profit.

:::To be successful this idea must emphasize what people can do for themselves.  I am curious about what message they are trying to communicate in a TV ad when they describe their product as &quot;patented&quot;.  How is that possibly going to make that product work better, or be better suited for its purpose?  What con game are they playing?  What are the ingredients in a can of commercial paint thinner that you get at a hardware store?  Leaving aside questions of poisons and carcinogens, is there something that I could mix myself for a lot cheaper that could do the job more easily?  I hope you get my point. :-)  I seem to be ranting on in the gospel of self-reliance.  Consumerism relies on personal incompetance, including the inability of the average man-of-the-house to perform the most elementary of household repairs.  Public patents that provide a practical guide to overcoming this defect could be very welcome. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 19:56, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Changes to layout ==

[[oldwikisource:User:AaronSw|AaronSw]]'s changes were rightly reverted since they were quite radical and not discussed beforehand at all.  I think the [[oldwikisource:Main Page]] is great the way it is and I wasn't a fan of what he did to the Author template either, but I did like [http://wikisource.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Main_Page:English&amp;oldid=15594 his way] of organizing the English Main Page.  Therefore I would like to discuss if we could organize the categories the way he did: i.e. more succinctly and structured.  Personally I think it gives the reader more options to find what they want faster.  Obviously he didn't go about it the right way but anyone else agree that the English Main page looked better the new way? - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 11:01, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:The intent in structuring the English Main Page the way that it is was based on a decision tree that would allow the placement of any article.  At least the left half has been that way.  It allows any and all articles to be traced back to the Main Page.  (I've taken very little interest in the right half, even though I've noticed that some of the new articles remain new for a very long time.)  The thinking behind it has you begin at the top of the list, ask the question, and if the answer is yes put the article under that heading; if no go on to the next question.  At the end of the series of questions you reach &quot;none of the above&quot;.  I admit that I have been remiss in properly documenting that process.  The word &quot;categories&quot; at the head of that box was there long before the current category system was devised, and may now be misleading. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 20:13, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::This kind of decision tree would be more appropriate on a &quot;how to add an article&quot; page. People want to find articles in all sorts of ways, and the front page should be geared to them.

:::OK now I know what the questions were for, I never understood :)  But as Aaronsw says, a decision tree would probably be more appropriate on something like the [[How to submit a text]] page, while a more index-like layout would be better for the main page in my opinion.  And really, the substance doesnt really change much: the proposed version contains all the links that are on the current version, only organized differently and adding links to category-like pages ([[Wikisource:Letters|Letters]], [[Wikisource:Poetry|Poetry]] etc).  All pages could still be traced back to the Main Page, in fact more of them (the category-like pages) could.

:::As for the misleading categories header, I agree its a bit outdated.  I for one completely forgot about [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Poetry|the poetry page]] when I added [[oldwikisource:The Hunting of the Snark]], I just listed it from Lewis Carroll's author page and thought I was done.  Linking to a document from multiple places like that seems annoying and unnecessary: shouldn't we make those true categories so we can just put a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Poetry]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; link on a page? - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 00:13, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::::Ooh boy, just went back and read through the whole discussion about categories at the scriptorium.  So are we officially using the Library of Congress system or what?  I'm kinda confused about the whole issue. - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 00:29, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Relegating something to a &quot;How to add an article&quot; page would be a ticket to oblivion.  There is plenty of room for both approches on the English Main Page; that has always been the case.  The most important feature about the &quot;Primary categories&quot; (and I'm now considering changing that title to &quot;Primary links&quot;) is that it is comprehensive, ''i.e.'' absolutely every article can be linked through it.  No-one is obliged to link from multiple places; linking from an author page is quite sufficient.  If someone wants to make an additional link from the poetry page they are welcome to do it, though eventually any good category system should make such pages based on genre redundant.  My suggestion at this point would be for those who want change to develop the right side of the page to their satisfaction.  I'm not likely to take a significant role in that exercise.  When that is done, perhaps we can better co-ordinate our different efforts.

::There is nothing obligatory or even &quot;official&quot; about using the Library of Congress Classification System (LC).  Nor is there anything to prevent or forbid multiple category systems.  Nevertheless, if someone wants to start another coded system they would do well to insure that all their categories are clearly identified as being from that system.  To the extent that the LC system is used here, it has already been much modified, and has thus only served as a general guideline for a coded structure.  To make a long story short, a significant part of the rationale for a coded system was to enable &quot;categories&quot; or &quot;subjects&quot; in multiple languages that would redirect to a common code.  Thus &quot;poetry&quot;, &quot;poésie&quot;, &quot;poesia&quot;, etc. could all redirect to Class &quot;PNE&quot;. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:42, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I'm a believer in trying things out myself to get other people interested in them. If I make mistakes, people are inspired by learning from them. If I happen to possibly have a good idea, people are inspired to take that into account and improve upon it with their own ideas. It was for that reason that I've spent a couple of fun hours working on [[oldwikisource:User:Icurite:Mainpage|my attempt at a main page]] while I surfed around the place. Hopefully, both the strengths and more likely the weaknesses of my design will inspire some further discussion and possibly even some action.

I do strongly feel, however, that categories need to be used more. Just like I add uncategorized articles to categories at Wikipedia, I also do the same here. And I also agree with another comment I read on this talk page that the Main Page needs to become more of a general internet resource rather than a contributor's resource. [[oldwikisource:User:Icurite|Icurite]]

== External linking ? ==
I have a question about linking out to outside pages where sources are stored.
Can we put links to the sites with these sources or do we only allow for WikiSource stored content?
I understand that we would like to make the texts available on WikiSource site. This way anybody can access them right here. But then there are thousands of texts which are available to read and download but have restrictions as far as publishing is concerned.

One example is the University of Virginia electronic resources. There are great many etexts there but the publisher does not allow for them to be re-published without permision (see http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/conditions.html ).

But instead of taking their etexts and publishing them on WikiSource, we could of course create links to good sources where the etexts are kept.

To give you one example: I added a book for WikiSource author [[oldwikisource:Author:Horatio Alger|Horatio Alger]], [[oldwikisource:Ragged Dick, or, Street Life in New York]]. This link, instead of leading to the text on WikiSource, directs to Virginia University collection. You might say that it is better to have the text on Wiki. But then some texts are not available because of copywright reasons. Directing to external sources allows us to have authors' collection more complete.

What do you think?  ([[oldwikisource:User:Aiks|Aiks]] 18:55, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC))

:When dealing with issues of this sort one needs to distinguish between what is not allowed, and what is merely not recommended.  Clear violations of copyright without adequate justification should clearly not be allowed.  Duplicating material that is easily found elsewhere is not recommended.  In general I have no problem with linking, but I would find it useless and disappointing if the '''only''' work that we mentioned by an author linked to an outside source.

:Alger was a prolific author, and you are obviously interested in his work.  Your point about having a more complete collection is absolutely valid.  Developing a good bibliography of his works on the author page certainly fits well with my own vision of this project.  Researching the availability of material is a part of bibliographic work, and UVa texts do tend to be in a format that is consistent with the way we would like to present things to our readers.  Contrast this with those sites that have pdf files, or images, or are non-searchable, or filled with ads.  Of course, if we want to do more than carry a bare text, adding such features as links to Wiktionary, having the text in our databse would be essential... but were not there ... yet.

:As to UVa's Terms of Use, I find much of what they say to be ''ultra vires''.  They have no way of legally preventing you from using that part of their texts which is already in the public domain.  Their scanning and proofreading work is not copyrightable.  Some of their added material may be, but we're not interested in that anyway.

==Logo suggestion==
See: [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Revising the &quot;Sourceberg&quot; logo]]

== Original works ==

It says in [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?]] that original writings are excluded from wikisource.  Since Wikibooks is for textbooks, does that mean that if I want to release an essay under the GFDL, it wouldn't be welcomed here? -[[oldwikisource:User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]] 17:43, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:Hi, If it is some work written in University (thesis, etc.), it is accepted as we consider that is published work. Otherwise what is the subject of your essay ? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 18:55, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks for your response.  I wasn't talking about a specific essay, I just have a few essays on my computer that I would be willing to GFDL; but it wasn't a university paper, just an old highschool assignment.  I'm not very familiar with how things work on wikisource...would it be beneficial to submit it? Would others be able to edit my work? I do a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, but I'm not too familiar with wikisource, so please excuse my ignorance! -[[User:Frazzydee|[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]]]] 19:27, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::When it comes to what should be posted here on Wikisource, we really only want things that have been published in the past.  For example, books, speeches, journal articles, are good things to start with--we want things that have been made widely available to the public.  In your case, it would not be advised to submit those essays here.  We've had Wikisource users submit their own writings before, and each entry has been deleted.  The same would happen in your case, too.  If you would like to publish your essays, I advise another place, such as [http://www.fictionpress.com FictionPress.com].  That site is more designed for what you want, and there are ways for you to attract people to read the essays you post there, also.

I had intended to include some legendary sagas from Norse mythology, but I am not sure of in which category they belong. Most of them have some historic basis, but they are mixed with fiction.--[[oldwikisource:User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 08:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Moving &quot;Community&quot; section to the &quot;Community portal&quot; page? ==

Thought I'd check if there was a good reason why this hasn't be done. The community portal section '''A)''' is below the fold '''B)''' has content more appropriate for the under-developed &quot;Community portal&quot; page. I think the community portal page is very undeveloped considering the continued growth of Wikisource. I know the community page does not the need quite the scale and size of the Wikipedia version (and to be honest I don't think the WP page it's very usable unless you're used to it), but does anyone object to some general improvements of the CP page, perhaps containing some of the main page community links? [[oldwikisource:User:GregRobson|GregRobson]] 8 July 2005 17:50 (UTC)

:Yes, the community portal is definitely underdeveloped. I don't think anybody would mind if you start to work on it, just go ahead. --[[oldwikisource:User:Christian S|Christian S]] 8 July 2005 19:30 (UTC)

::Please, go right ahead!  It keeps me from having to track it all down and do it myself :).  I do think we need to make a lot more use of the Community Portal (although it wasn't until recently that we revamped what it currently is).  But by all means, go ahead and work on it!  {{User:Zhaladshar/sig}} 8 July 2005 19:32 (UTC)

The changes have been made, and therefore the Community Portal [[oldwikisource:Wikisource talk:Community Portal|talk page]] should be used for discussion on that. The respective (yellow) section has been amended and the language information moved to the bottom like the 'pedia version. I still think this page could be improved, but it's almost midnight here and it would probably be better if I slept on my ideas! [[oldwikisource:User:GregRobson|GregRobson]] 8 July 2005 22:54 (UTC)

----

I think there ought to be at least some very small section on the front page that links to fundimental and frequently used areas, like the Community Portal page and perhaps the Scriptorium.  This is common on most Wikimedia project front pages, but is currently missing here.  Still, I like the idea of using the Community portal more strongly than it typical is done.  Otherwise it is totally confusing for a new user just trying to figure things out (even though &quot;Community Portal&quot; is listed as a part of the &quot;navigation&quot; bar for most skin types.)  [[oldwikisource:User:Robert Horning|Robert Horning]] 9 July 2005 18:12 (UTC)

==Translations of Opera Libretti==

I propose a project called Wikisource Opera, where the original libretti of the operas can be accompanied by translations into a number of other languages.  This will be useful, because no project of this sort is available on the internet, and because a number of record companies release recordings without the original translations and/or libretti.

We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss,
and today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the
missing and the dead, and for those who loved them.

On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty. We have
seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel. Now come the names, the list of
casualties we are only beginning to read.

They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an
airport busy with life. They are the names of people who faced death and in their last
moments called home to say, &quot;Be brave&quot; and &quot;I love you.&quot; They are the names of
passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of others on the
ground. They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United
States and died at their posts. They are the names of rescuers, the ones whom death
found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others.

We will read all these names, we will linger over them and learn their stories, and
many Americans will weep. To the children and parents and spouses and families
and friends of the lost, we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation.

And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days removed from these events,
Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but our responsibility to history is
already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged
against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when
stirred to anger.

This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way and at
an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our wounds as a
people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray.

In many of our prayers this week, there is a searching and an honesty. At St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York on Tuesday, a woman said, &quot;I pray to God to give
us a sign that he's still here.&quot; Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to
hospital, carrying pictures of those still missing. God's signs are not always the ones
we look for. We learn in tragedy that his purposes are not always our own.

Yet the prayers and private suffering, whether in our homes or in this great cathedral,
are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help us last through the
day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us
strength for the journey. And there are prayers that yield our will to a will greater
than our own.

This world he created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a
time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end. And the Lord of life hold all
who die and all who mourn.

It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation, as well. In
this trial, we have been reminded, and the world has seen, that our fellow Americans
are generous and kind, resourceful and brave. We see our national character in
rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blood donors, in thousands of
citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible.

And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice. Inside the
World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end at
the side of his quadriplegic friend. A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a
firefighter. Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68
floors to safety. A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington
to bring skin grafts for burn victims.

In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another
and an abiding love for our country.

Today we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called the &quot;warm courage of national unity.&quot;
This is the unity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political
parties in both houses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight
vigils, and American flags which are displayed in pride and wave in defiance. Our
unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And
this unity against terror is now extending across the world.

America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for; but we are
not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of
human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and
defender. And the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time.

On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask almighty God to watch over
our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that he
will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank him for each life
we now must mourn and the promise of a life to come.

As we've been assured: Neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth can separate us
from God's love. May he bless the souls of the departed, may he comfort our own,
and may he always guide our country.

God bless America.

&quot;Thank You, Commissioners:

My name is Ryan White. I am sixteen years old. I have hemophilia, and I have AIDS.

When I was three days old, the doctors told my parents I was a severe hemophiliac, meaning my blood does not clot. Lucky for me, there was a product just approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It was called Factor VIII, which contains the clotting agent found in blood.

While I was growing up, I had many bleeds or hemorhages in my joints which make it very painful. Twice a week I would receive injections or IV's of Factor VIII which clotted the blood and then broke it down. A bleed occurs from a broken blood vessel or vein. The blood then had nowhere to go so it would swell up in a joint. You could compare it to trying to pour a quart of milk into a pint-sized container of milk.

The first five to six years of my life were spent in and out of the hospital. All in all I led a pretty normal life. Most recently my battle has been against AIDS and the discrimination surrounding it. On December 17, 1984, I had surgery to remove two inches of my left lung due to pneumonia. After two hours of surgery the doctors told my mother I had AIDS. I contracted AIDS through my Factor VIII which is made from blood. When I came out of surgery, I was on a respirator and had a tube in my left lung. I spent Christmas and the next thirty days in the hospital. A lot of my time was spent searching, thinking and planning my life.

I came face to face with death at thirteen years old. I was diagnosed with AIDS: a killer. Doctors told me I'm not contagious. Given six months to live and being the fighter that I am, I set high goals for myself. It was my decision to live a normal life, go to school, be with my friends, and enjoying day to day activities. It was not going to be easy.

The school I was going to said they had no guidelines for a person with AIDS. The school board, my teachers, and my principal voted to keep me out of the classroom even after the guidelines were set by the I.S.B.H., for fear of someone getting AIDS from me by casual contact. Rumors of sneezing, kissing, tears, sweat, and saliva spreading AIDS caused people to panic.

We began a series of court battles for nine months, while I was attending classes by telephone. Eventually, I won the right to attend school, but the prejudice was still there. Listening to medical facts was not enough. People wanted one hundred percent guarantees. There are no one hundred percent guarantees in life, but concessions were made by Mom and me to help ease the fear. We decided to meet them halfway:

* Separate restrooms
* No gym
* Separate drinking fountains
* Disposable eating utensils and trays

Even though we knew AIDS was not spread through casual contact. Nevertheless, parents of twenty students started their own school. They were still not convinced. Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me:

* I became the target of Ryan White jokes
* Lies about me biting people
* Spitting on vegetables and cookies
* Urinating on bathroom walls
* Some restaurants threw away my dishes
* My school locker was vandalized inside and folders were marked FAG and other obscenities

I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand.

This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school. Mayor Koch, of New York, was the first public figure to give me support. Entertainers, athletes, and stars started giving me support. I met some of the greatest like Elton John, Greg Louganis, Max Headroom, Alyssa Milano (my teen idol), Lyndon King (Los Angeles Raiders), and Charlie Sheen. All of these plus many more became my friends, but I had very few friends at school. How could these people in the public eye not be afraid of me, but my whole town was?

It was difficult, at times, to handle; but I tried to ignore the injustice, because I knew the people were wrong. My family and I held no hatred for those people because we realized they were victims of their own ignorance. We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around. Financial hardships were rough on us, even though Mom had a good job at G.M. The more I was sick, the more work she had to miss. Bills became impossible to pay. My sister, Andrea, was a championship roller skater who had to sacrifice too. There was no money for her lessons and travel. AIDS can destroy a family if you let it, but luckily for my sister and me, Mom taught us to keep going. Don't give up, be proud of who you are, and never feel sorry for yourself.

After two and a half years of declining health, two attacks of pneumocystis, shingles, a rare form of whooping cough, and liver problems, I faced fighting chills, fevers, coughing, tiredness, and vomiting. I was very ill and being tutored at home. The desire to move into a bigger house, to avoid living AIDS daily, and a dream to be accepted by a community and school, became possible and a reality with a movie about my life, The Ryan White Story.

My life is better now. At the end of the school year (1986-87), my family and I decided to move to Cicero, Indiana. We did a lot of hoping and praying that the community would welcome us, and they did. For the first time in three years, we feel we have a home, a supportive school, and lots of friends. The communities of Cicero, Atlanta, Arcadia, and Noblesville, Indiana, are now what we call &quot;home.&quot; I'm feeling great. I am a normal happy teenager again. I have a learner's permit. I attend sports functions and dances. My studies are important to me. I made the honor roll just recently, with 2 A's and 2 B's. I'm just one of the kids, and all because the students at Hamilton Heights High School listened to the facts, educated their parents and themselves, and believed in me.

I believe in myself as I look forward to graduating from Hamilton Heights High School in 1991.

Hamilton Heights High School is proof that AIDS EDUCATION in schools works.&quot;

 | notes      = The '''United States Declaration of Independence''' is a statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, announcing that the Thirteen Colonies then at war with Great Britain were no longer a part of the British Empire. Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration is a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The birthday of the United States of America—Independence Day—is celebrated on July 4, the day the wording of the Declaration was adopted by the Congress.

Congress issued the Declaration in several forms. The first published version was a typeset broadside printed by John Dunlap, which only listed the names of John Hancock and Charles Thomson as signers. In 1777, Congress issued the Goddard Broadside, which listed all of the signers. What became the most famous version of the Declaration was a handwritten copy signed by the delegates, known as the engrossed version, which is on display in the National Archives in Washington, D.C.''

The Declaration of Independence is the first of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

See also the [[Draft of the Declaration of Independence]] and [[United States Declaration of Independence (as it was written)]].

The Dunlap Broadside, the Goddard Broadside, and Engrossed Declaration vary slightly. What follows is the Declaration as it appears in the Dunlap Broadside.

'''Joint Statement by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, August 14, 1941:'''

The following statement signed by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain is released for the information of the Press:

The President of the United States and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, have met at sea.

They have been accompanied by officials of their two Governments, including high ranking officers of the Military, Naval and Air Services.

The whole problem of the supply of munitions of war, as provided by the Lease-Lend Act, for the armed forces of the United States and for those countries actively engaged in resisting aggression has been further examined.

Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Supply of the British Government, has joined in these conferences. He is going to proceed to Washington to discuss further details with appropriate officials of the United States Government. These conferences will also cover the supply problems of the Soviet Union.

The President and the Prime Minister have had several conferences They have considered the dangers to world civilization arising from the policies of military domination by conquest upon which the Hitlerite government of Germany and other governments associated therewith have embarked, and have made clear the stress which their countries are respectively taking for their safety in the face of these dangers.

They have agreed upon the following joint declaration:

----

Joint declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.

'''First''', their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;

'''Second''', they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned;

''' Third''', they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them;

''' Fourth''', they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity;

''' Fifth''', they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security;

''' Sixth''', after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want;

''' Seventh''', such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance;

''' Eighth''', they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.

:Signed by: Franklin D. Roosevelt &amp; Winston S. Churchill

===Part I : Optimism Within===
Could we choose our environment, and were desire in human undertakings synonymous with endowment, all men would, I suppose, be optimists. Certainly most of us regard happiness as the proper end of all earthly enterprise. The will to be happy animates alike the philosopher, the prince and the chimney-sweep. No matter how dull, or how mean, or how wise a man is, he feels that happiness is his indisputable right.

It is curious to observe what different ideals of happiness people cherish, and in what singular places they look for this well-spring of their life. Many look for it in the hoarding of riches, some in the pride of power, and others in the achievements of art and literature; a few seek it in the exploration of their own minds, or in the search for knowledge.

Most people measure their happiness in terms of physical pleasure and material possession. Could they win some visible goal which they have set on the horizon, how happy they would be! Lacking this gift or that circumstance, they would be miserable. If happiness is to be so measured, I who cannot hear or see have every reason to sit in a corner with folded hands and weep. If I am happy in spite of my deprivations, if my happiness is so deep that it is a faith, so thoughtful that it becomes a philosophy of life, —if, in short, I am an optimist, my testimony to the creed of optimism is worth hearing. As sinners stand up in meeting and testify to the goodness of God, so one who is called afflicted may rise up in gladness of conviction and testify to the goodness of life.

Once I knew the depth where no hope was, and darkness lay on the face of all things. Then love came and set my soul free. Once I knew only darkness and stillness. Now I know hope and joy. Once I fretted and beat myself against the wall that shut me in. Now I rejoice in the consciousness that I can think, act and attain heaven. My life was without past or future; death, the pessimist would say, &quot;a consummation devoutly to be wished.&quot; But a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living. Night fled before the day of thought, and love and joy and hope came up in a passion of obedience to knowledge. Can anyone who escaped such captivity, who has felt the thrill and glory of freedom, be a pessimist?

My early experience was thus a leap from bad to good. If I tried, I could not check the momentum of my first leap out of the dark; to move breast forward as a habit learned suddenly at that first moment of release and rush into the light. With the first word I used intelligently, I learned to live, to think, to hope. Darkness cannot shut me in again. I have had a glimpse of the shore, and can now live by the hope of reaching it.

So my optimism is no mild and unreasoning satisfaction. A poet once said I must be happy because I did not see the bare, cold present, but lived in a beautiful dream. I do live in a beautiful dream; but that dream is the actual, the present, —not cold, but warm; not bare, but furnished with a thousand blessings. The very evil which the poet supposed would be a cruel disillusionment is necessary to the fullest knowledge of joy. Only by contact with evil could I have learned to feel by contrast the beauty of truth and love and goodness.

It is a mistake always to contemplate the good and ignore the evil, because by making people neglectful it lets in disaster. There is a dangerous optimism of ignorance and indifference. It is not enough to say that the twentieth century is the best age in the history of mankind, and to take refuge from the evils of the world in skyey dreams of good. How many good men, prosperous and contented, looked around and saw naught but good, while millions of their fellow-men were bartered and sold like cattle! No doubt, there were comfortable optimists who thought Wilberforce a meddlesome fanatic when he was working with might and main to free the slaves. I distrust the rash optimism in this country that cries, &quot;Hurrah, we're all right! This is the greatest nation on earth,&quot; when there are grievances that call loudly for redress. That is false optimism. Optimism that does not count the cost is like a house builded on sand. A man must understand evil and be acquainted with sorrow before he can write himself an optimist and expect others to believe that he has reason for the faith that is in him.

I know what evil is. Once or twice I have wrestled with it, and for a time felt its chilling touch on my life; so I speak with knowledge when I say that evil is of no consequence, except as a sort of mental gymnastic. For the very reason that I have come in contact with it, I am more truly an optimist. I can say with conviction that the struggle which evil necessitates is one of the greatest blessings. It makes us strong, patient, helpful men and women. It lets us into the soul of things and teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it. My optimism, then, does not rest on the absence of evil, but on a glad belief in the preponderance of good and a willing effort always to cooperate with the good, that it may prevail. I try to increase the power God has given me to see the best in everything and every one, and make that Best a part of my life. The world is sown with good; but unless I turn my glad thoughts into practical living and till my own field, I cannot reap a kernel of the good.

Thus my optimism is grounded in two worlds, myself and what is about me. I demand that the world be good, and lo, it obeys. I proclaim the world good, and facts range themselves to prove my proclamation overwhelmingly true. To what good I open the doors of my being, and jealously shut them against what is bad. Such is the force of this beautiful and willful conviction, it carries itself in the face of all opposition. I am never discouraged by absence of good. I never can be argued into hopelessness. Doubt and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination, which the steadfast heart will conquer, and the large mind transcend.

As my college days draw to a close, I find myself looking forward with beating heart and bright anticipations to what the future holds of activity for me. My share in the work of the world may be limited; but the fact that it is work makes it precious. Nay, the desire and will to work is optimism itself.

Two generations ago Carlyle flung forth his gospel of work. To the dreamers of the Revolution, who built cloud-castles of happiness, and, when the inevitable winds rent the castles asunder, turned pessimists —to those ineffectual Endymions, Alastors and Werthers, this Scots peasant, man of dreams in the hard, practical world, cried aloud his creed of labor. &quot;Be no longer a Chaos, but a World. Produce! produce! Were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of product, produce it, in God's name! 'Tis the utmost thou hast in thee; out with it, then. Up, up! whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called To-day; for the Night cometh wherein no man may work.&quot;

Some have said Carlyle was taking refuge from a hard world by bidding men grind and toil, eyes to the earth, and so forget their misery. This is not Carlyle's thought. &quot;Fool!&quot; he cries, &quot;the Ideal is in thyself; the Impediment is also in thyself. Work out the Ideal in the poor, miserable Actual; live, think, believe, and be free!&quot; It is plain what he says, that work, production, brings life out of chaos, makes the individual a world, an order; and order is optimism.

I, too, can work, and because I love to labor with my head and my hands, I am an optimist in spite of all. I used to think I should be thwarted in my desire to do something useful. But I have found out that through the ways in which I can make myself useful are few, yet the work open to me is endless. The gladdest laborer in the vineyard may be a cripple. Even should the others outstrip him, yet the vineyard ripens in the sun each year, and the full clusters weigh into his hand. Darwin could work only half an hour at a time; yet in many diligent half-hours he laid anew the foundations of philosophy. I long to accomplish a great and noble task; but it is my chief duty and joy to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. It is my service to think how I can best fulfill the demands that each day makes upon me, and to rejoice that others can do what I cannot. Green, the historian, tells us that the world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker; and that thought alone suffices to guide me in this dark world and wide. I love the good that others do; for their activity is an assurance that whether I can help or not, the true and the good will stand sure.

I trust, and nothing that happens disturbs my trust. I recognize the beneficence of the power which we all worship as supreme— Order, Fate, the Great Spirit, Nature, God. I recognize this power in the sun that makes all things grow and keeps life afoot. I make a friend of this indefinable force, and straightway I feel glad, brave and ready for any lot Heaven may decree for me. This is my religion of optimism.

===Part II : Optimism Without===
Optimism, then, is a fact within my own heart. But as I look out upon life, my heart meets no contradiction. The outward world justifies my inward universe of good. All through the years I have spent in college, my reading has been a continuous discovery of good. In literature, philosophy, religion and history I find the mighty witnesses to my faith.

Philosophy is the history of a deaf-blind person writ large. From the talks of Socrates up through Plato, Berkeley and Kant, philosophy records the efforts of human intelligence to be free of the clogging material world and fly forth into a universe of pure idea. A deaf-blind person ought to find special meaning in Plato's Ideal World. These things which you see and hear and touch are not the reality of realities, but imperfect manifestations of the Idea, the Principal, the Spiritual; the Idea is the truth, the rest is delusion.

If this be so, my brethren who enjoy the fullest use of the senses are not aware of any reality which may not equally well be in reach of my mind. Philosophy gives to the mind the prerogative of seeing truth, and bears us not a realm where I, who am blind, and not different from you who see. When I learned from Berkeley that your eyes receive an inverted image of things which your brain unconsciously corrects, I began to suspect that the eye is not a very reliable instrument after all, and I felt as one who had been restored to equality with others, glad, not because the senses avail them so little, but because in God's eternal world, mind and spirit avail so much. It seemed to me that philosophy had been written for my special consolation, whereby I get even with some modern philosophers who apparently think that I was intended as an experimental case for their special instruction! But in a little measure my small voice of individual experience does join in the declaration of philosophy that the good is the only world, and that world is a world of spirit. It is also a universe where order is All, where an unbroken logic holds the parts together, where distance defines itself as non-existence, where evil, as St. Augustine held, is delusion, and therefore is not.

The meaning of philosophy to me is not only its principles, but also in the happy isolation of its great expounders. They were seldom of the world, even when like Plato and Leibnitz they moved in its courts and drawing rooms. To the tumult of life they were deaf, and they were blind to its distraction and perplexing diversities. Sitting alone, but not in darkness, they learned to find everything in themselves, and failing to find it even there, they still trusted in meeting the truth face to face when they should leave the earth behind and become partakers in the wisdom of God. The great mystics lived alone, deaf and blind, but dwelling with God.

I understand how it was possible for Spinoza to find deep and sustained happiness when he was excommunicated, poor, despised and suspected alike by Jew and Christian; not that the kind world of men ever treated me so, but that his isolation from the universe of sensuous joys is somewhat analogous to mine. He loved the good for its own sake. Like many great spirits he accepted his place in the world, and confided himself childlike to a higher power, believing that it worked through his hands and predominated in his being. He trusted implicitly, and that is what I do. Deep, solemn optimism, it seems to me, should spring from this firm belief in the presence of God in the individual; not a remote, unapproachable governor of the universe, but a God who is very near every one of us, who is present not only in earth, sea and sky, but also in every pure and noble impulse of our hearts, &quot;the source and centre of all minds, their only point of rest.&quot;

Thus from the philosophy I learn that we see only shadows and know only in part, and that all things change; but the mind, the unconquerable mind, compasses all truth, embraces the universe as it is, converts the shadows to realities and makes tumultuous changes seem but moments in an eternal silence, or short lines in the infinite theme of perfection, and the evil but &quot;a halt on the way to good.&quot; Though with my hand I grasp only a small part of the universe, with my spirit I see the whole, and in my thought I can compass the beneficent laws by which it is governed. The confidence and trust which these conceptions inspire teach me to rest safe in my life as in a fate, and protect me from spectral doubts and fears. Verily, blessed are ye that have not seen, and yet have believed.

All the world's great philosophers have been lovers of God and believers in man's inner goodness. To know the history of philosophy is to know that the highest thinkers of the ages, the seers of the tribes and the nations, have been optimists.

The growth of philosophy is the story of man's spiritual life. Outside lies that great mass of events which we call History. As I look on this mass I see it take form and shape itself in the ways of God. The history of man is an epic of progress. In the world within and the world without I see a wonderful correspondence, a glorious symbolism which reveals the human divine communing together, the lesson of philosophy repeated in fact. In all the parts that compose, the history of mankind hides the spirit of good, and gives meaning to the whole.

Far back in the twilight of history I see the savage fleeing from the forces of nature which he has not learned control, and seeking to propitiate supernatural beings which are but the creation of his superstitious fear. With a shift of his imagination I see the savage emancipated, civilized. He no longer worships the grim deities of ignorance. Through suffering he has learned to build a roof over his head, to defend his life and his home, and over his state he has erected a temple in which he worships the joyous gods of light and song. From suffering he has learned justice; from the struggle with his fellows he has learned the distinction between right and wrong which makes him a moral being. He is sighted with the genius of Greece.

But Greece was not perfect. Her poetical and religious ideals were far above her practice; therefore she died, that her ideals might survive to ennoble coming ages.

Rome, too, left the world a rich inheritance. Through the vicissitudes of history her laws and ordered government have stood a majestic object-lesson for the ages. But when the stern, frugal character of her people ceased to be the bone and sinew of her civilization, Rome fell.

Then came the new nations of the North and founded a more permanent society. The base of Greek and Roman society was the slave, crushed into the condition of the wretches who &quot;labored, foredone in the field and at the workshop, like haltered horses, if blind, so much the quieter.&quot; The base of the new society was the freeman who fought, tilled, judged and grew from more to more. He wrought a state out of tribal kinship and fostered an independence and self-reliance which no oppression could destroy. The story of man's slow ascent from savagery through barbarism and self-mastery to civilization is the embodiment of the spirit of optimism. From the first hour of the new nations each century has seen a better Europe, until the development of the world demanded America.

Tolstoi said the other day that America, once the hope of the world, was in bondage to Mammon. Tolstoi and other Europeans have still much to learn about this great, free country of ours before they understand the unique civic struggle which America is undergoing. She is confronted with the mighty task of assimilating all the foreigners that are drawn together from every country, and welding them into one people with one national spirit. We have the right to demand the forbearance of critics until the United States has demonstrated whether she can make one people out of all nations of the earth. London economists are alarmed at less than five hundred thousand foreign-born in a population of six million, and discuss earnestly the danger of too many aliens. But what is their problem in comparison with that of New York, which counts nearly one million five hundred thousand foreigners among its three and a half million citizens? Think of it! Every third person in our American metropolis is an alien. By these figures alone America's greatness can be measured.

It is true, America has devoted herself largely to the solution of material problems—breaking the fields, opening mines, irrigating the deserts, spanning the continent with railroads; but she is doing these things in a new way, by educating her people, by placing at the service of every man's need every resource of human skill. She is transmuting her industrial wealth into the education of her workmen, so that unskilled people shall have no place in American life, so that all men shall bring mind and soul to the control of matter. Her children are not drudges and slaves. The Constitution has declared it, and the spirit of our institutions has confirmed it. The best the land can teach them they shall know. They shall learn that there is no upper class in their country, and no lower, and they shall understand how it is that God and His world are for everybody.

America might do all this, and still be selfish, still be a worshipper of Mammon. But America is the home of charity as well as commerce. In the midst of roaring traffic, side by side with noisy factory and sky-reaching warehouse, one sees the school, the library, the hospital, the park-works of public benevolence which represent wealth wrought into ideas that shall endure forever. Behold what America has already done to alleviate suffering and restore the afflicted to society —given sight to the fingers of the blind, language to the dumb lip, and mind to the idiot clay, and tell me if indeed she worships Mammon only. Who shall measure the sympathy, skill and intelligence with which she ministers to all who come to her, and lessens the ever-swelling tide of poverty, misery and degradation which every year rolls against her gates from all the nations? When I reflect on all these facts, I cannot but think that, Tolstoi and other theorists to the contrary, it is a splendid thing to be an American. In America the optimist finds abundant reason for confidence in the present and hope for the future, and this hope, this confidence, may well extend over all the great nations of the earth.

If we compare our own time with the past, we find in modern statistics a solid foundation for a confident and buoyant world-optimism. Beneath the doubt, the unrest, the materialism, which surround us still glows and burns at the world's best life a steadfast faith. To hear the pessimist, one would think civilization Had bivouacked in the Middle Ages, and had not had marching orders since. He does not realize that the progress of evolution is not an uninterrupted march.

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;Now touching goal, now backward hurl'd,
: Toils the indomitable world.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

I have recently read an address by one whose knowledge it would be presumptuous to challenge. In it I find abundant evidence of progress.

During the past fifty years crime has decreased. True, the records of to-day contain a longer list of crime. But our statistics are more complete and accurate than the statistics of times past. Besides, there are many offenses on the list which half a century ago would not have been thought of as crimes. This shows that the public conscience is more sensitive than it ever was.

Our definition of crime has grown stricter, our punishment of it more lenient and intelligent. The old feeling of revenge has largely disappeared. It is no longer an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The criminal is treated as one who is diseased. He is confined not merely for punishment, but because he is a menace to society. While he is under restraint, he is treated with human care and disciplined so that his mind shall be cured of its disease, and he shall be restored to society able to so his part of its work.

Another sign of awakened and enlightened public conscience is the effort to provide the working-class with better houses. Did it occur to anyone a hundred years ago to think whether the dwellings of the poor were sanitary, convenient or sunny? Do not forget that in the &quot;good old times&quot; cholera and typhus devastated whole counties, and that pestilence walked abroad in the capitals of Europe.

Not only have our laboring-classes better houses and better places to work in; but employers recognize the right of the employed to seek more than the bare wage of existence. In the darkness and turmoil of our modern industrial strifes we discern but dimly the principles that underlie the struggle. The recognition of the right of all men to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, a spirit of conciliation such as Burke dreamed of, the willingness on the part of the strong to make concessions to the weak, the realization that the rights of the employer are bound up in the rights of the employed —in these the optimist beholds the signs of our times.

Another right which State has recognized as belonging to each man is the right to an education. In the enlightened parts of Europe and in America every city, every town, every village, has its school; and it is no longer a class who have access to knowledge, for to the children of the poorest laborer the school-door stands open. From the civilized nations universal education is driving the dull host of illiteracy.

Education broadens to include all men, and deepens to teach all truths. Scholars are no longer confined to Greek, Latin and mathematics, but they also study science converts the dreams of the poet, the theory of the mathematician and the fiction of the economist into ships, hospitals and instruments that enable one skilled hand to perform the work of a thousand. The student of to-day is not asked if he has learned his grammar. Is he a mere grammar machine, a dry catalogue of scientific facts, or has he acquired the qualities of manliness? His supreme lesson is to grapple with great public questions, to keep his mind hospitable to new idea and new views of truth, to restore the finer ideals that are lost sight of in the struggle for wealth and to promote justice between man and man. He learns that there may be substitutes for human labor —horse-power and machinery and books; but &quot;there are no substitutes for common sense, patience, integrity, courage.&quot;

Who can doubt the vastness of the achievements of education when one considers how different the conditions of the blind and the deaf is from what it was a century ago? They were then objects of superstitious pity, and shared the lowest beggar's lot. Everybody looked upon their case as hopeless, and this view plunged them deeper in despair. The blind themselves laughed in the face of Hauy when he offered to teach them to read. How pitiable is the cramped sense of imprisonment in circumstances which teaches men to expect no good and to treat any attempt to relieve them as the vagary of a disordered mind! But now, behold the transformation; see how institutions and industrial establishments for the blind have sprung up as if by magic; see how many of the deaf have learned not only to read and write, but to speak; and remember that the faith and patience of Dr. Howe have borne fruit in the efforts that are being made everywhere to educate the deaf-blind and equip them for the struggle. Do you wonder that I am full of hope and lifted up?

The highest result of education is tolerance. Long ago men fought and died for their faith; but it took ages to teach them the other kind of courage, —the courage to recognize the faiths of their brethren and their rights of conscience. Tolerance is the first principal of community; it is the spirit which conserves the best that all men think. No loss by flood and lightening, no destruction of cities and temples by the hostile forces of nature, has deprived man of so many noble lives and impulses as those which his tolerance has destroyed.

With wonder and sorrow I go back in thought to the ages of intolerance and bigotry. I see Jesus received with scorn and nailed on the cross. I see his followers hounded and tortured and burned. I am present where the finer spirits that revolt from the superstition of the Middle Ages are accused of impiety and stricken down. I behold the children of Israel reviled and persecuted unto death by those who pretend Christianity with the tongue; I see them driven from land to land, hunted from refuge to refuge, summoned to the felon's place, exposed to the whip, mocked as they utter amid the pain of martyrdom a confession of the faith which they have kept with such splendid constancy. The same bigotry that oppress the Jews falls tiger-like upon Christian nonconformists of purest lives and wipes out the Albigenses and the peaceful Vaudois, &quot;whose bones lie on the mountains cold.&quot; I see the clouds part slowly, and I hear a cry of protest against the bigot. The restraining hand of tolerance is laid upon the inquisitor, and the humanist utters a message of peace to the persecuted. Instead of the cry, &quot;Burn the heretic!&quot; men study the human soul with sympathy, and there enters into their hearts a new reverence for that which is unseen.

The idea of brotherhood redawns upon the world with a broader significance than the narrow association of members in a sect or creed; and thinkers of great soul like Lessing challenge the world to say which is more godlike, the hatred and tooth-and-nail grapple of conflicting religions, or sweet accord and mutual helpfulness. Ancient prejudice of man against his brother-man wavers and retreats before the radiance of a more generous sentiment, which will not sacrifice men to forms, or rob them of the comfort and strength they find in their own beliefs. The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next. Mere tolerance has given place to a sentiment of brotherhood between sincere men of all denominations. The optimist rejoices in the affectionate sympathy between Catholic heart and Protestant heart which finds a gratifying expression in the universal respect and warm admiration for Leo XIII on the part of good men the world over. The centenary celebrations of the births of Emerson and Channing are beautiful examples of the tribute which men of all creeds pay to the memory of a pure soul.

Thus in my outlook upon our times I find that I am glad to be a citizen of the world, as I regard my country, I find that to be an American is to be an optimist. I know the unhappy and unrighteous story of what has been done in the Philippines beneath our flag; but I believe that in the accidents of statecraft the best intelligence of the people sometimes fails to express itself. I read in history of Julius Caesar that during the civil wars there were millions of peaceful herdsmen and laborers who worked as long as they could, and fled before the advance of the armies that were led by the few, then waited until the danger was past, and returned to repair damages with patient hands. So the people are patient and honest, while their rulers stumble. I rejoice to see in the world and in this country a new and better patriotism than that which seeks the life of an enemy. It is a patriotism higher than that of the battle-field. It moves thousands to lay down their lives in social service, and every life so laid down brings us a step nearer the time when corn-fields shall no more be fields of battle. So when I heard of the cruel fighting in the Philippines, I did not despair, because I knew that the hearts of our people were not in that fight, and that sometime the hand of the destroyer must be stayed.

===Part III : The Practice of Optimism===
The test of all beliefs is their practical effect in life. It be true that optimism compels the world forward, and pessimism retards it, them it is dangerous to propagate a pessimistic philosophy. One who believes that the pain in the world outweighs the joy, and expresses that unhappy conviction, only adds to the pain. Schopenhauer is an enemy to the race. Even if he earnestly believed that this is the most wretched of possible worlds, he should not promulgate a doctrine which robs men of the incentive to fight with circumstance. If Life gave him ashes for bread, it was his fault. Life is a fair field, and the right will prosper if we stand by our guns.

Let pessimism once take hold of the mind, and life is all topsy-turvy, all vanity and vexation of spirit. There is no cure for individual or social disorder, except in forgetfulness and annihilation. &quot;Let us eat, drink and be merry,&quot; says the pessimist, &quot;for to-morrow we die.&quot; If I regarded my life from the point of view of the pessimist, I should be undone. I should seek in vain for the light that does not visit my eyes and the music that does not ring in my ears. I should beg night and day and never be satisfied. I should sit apart in awful solitude, a prey to fear and despair. But since I consider it a duty to myself and to others to be happy, I escape a misery worse than any physical deprivation.

Who shall dare let his incapacity for hope or goodness cast a shadow upon the courage of those who bear their burdens as if they were privileges? The optimist cannot fall back, cannot falter; for he knows his neighbor will be hindered by his failure to keep in line. He will therefore hold his place fearlessly and remember the duty of silence. Sufficient unto each heart is its own sorrow. He will take the iron claws of circumstance in his hand and use them as tools to break away the obstacle that block his path. He will work as if upon him alone depended the establishment of heaven and earth.

We have seen that the world's philosophers —the Sayers of the Word— were optimists; so also are the men of action and achievement —the Doers of the Word. Dr. Howe found his way to Laura Bridgman's soul because he began with the belief that he could reach it. English jurists had said that the deaf-blind were idiots in the eyes of the law. Behold what the optimist does. He converts a hard legal axiom; he looks behind the dull impassive clay and sees a human soul in bondage, and quietly, resolutely sets about its deliverance. His efforts are victorious. He creates intelligence out of idiocy and proves to the law that the deaf-blind man is a responsible being.

When Hauy offered to teach the blind to read, he was met by a pessimism that laughed at his folly. Had he not believed that the soul of man is mightier than the ignorance that fetters it, had he not been an optimist, he would not have turned the fingers of the blind into new instruments. No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit. St. Bernard was so deeply an optimist that he believed two hundred and fifty enlightened men could illuminate the darkness which overwhelmed the period of the Crusades; and the light of his faith broke like a new day upon western Europe. [[John Bosco]], the benefactor of the poor and the friendless of Italian cities, was another optimist, another prophet who, perceiving a Divine Idea while it was yet afar, proclaimed it to his countrymen. Although they laughed at his vision and called him a madman, yet he worked on patiently, and with the labor of his hands he maintained a home for little street waifs. In the fervor of enthusiasm he predicted the wonderful movement which should result from his work. Even in the days before he had money or patronage, he drew glowing pictures of the splendid system of schools and hospitals which should spread from one end of Italy to the other, and he lived to see the organization of the San Salvador Society, which was the embodiment of his prophetic optimism. When Dr. Seguin declared his opinion that the feeble-minded could be taught, again people laughed, and in their complacent wisdom said he was no better than an idiot himself. But the noble optimist persevered, and by and by the reluctant pessimists saw that he whom they ridiculed had become one of the world's philanthropists. Thus the optimist believes, attempts, achieves. He stands always in the sunlight. Some day the wonderful, the inexpressible, arrives and shines upon him, and he is there to welcome it. His soul meets his own and beats a glad march to every new discovery, every fresh victory over difficulties, every addition to human knowledge and happiness.

We have found that our great philosophers and our great men of action are optimists. So, too, our most potent men of letters have been optimists in their books and in their lives. No pessimist ever won an audience commensurately wide with his genius, and many optimistic writers have been read and admired out of all measure to their talents, simply because they wrote of the sunlit side of life. Dickens, Lamb, Goldsmith, Irving, all the well-beloved and gentle humorists, were optimists. Swift, the pessimist, has never had as many readers as his towering genius should command, and indeed, when he comes down into our century and meets Thackeray, that generous optimist can hardly do him justice. In spite of the latter-day notoriety of the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, we may set it down as a rule that he who would be heard must be a believer, must have a fundamental optimism in his philosophy. He may bluster and disagree and lament as Carlyle and Ruskin do sometimes; but a basic confidence in the good destiny of life and of the world must underlie his work.

Shakespeare is the prince of optimists. His tragedies are a revelation of moral order. In &quot;Lear&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; there is a looking forward to something better, some one is left at the end of the play to right wrong, restore society and build the state anew. The later plays, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; show a beautiful, placid optimism which delights in reconciliations and reunions and which plans for the triumph of external as well as internal good.

If Browning were less difficult to read, he would surely be the dominant poet in this century. I feel the ecstasy with which he exclaims, &quot;Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth this autumn morning!&quot; And how he sets my brain going when he says, because there is imperfection, there must be perfection; completeness must have come out of uncompleteness ; failure is an evidence of triumph for the fullness of the days. Yes, discord is, that harmony may be; pain destroys, that health may renew; perhaps I am deaf and blind that others likewise afflicted may see and hear with a more perfect sense! From Browning I learn that there is no lost good, and that makes it easier for me to go at life, right or wrong, do the best I know, and fear not. My heart responds proudly to his exhortation to pay gladly life's debt of pain, darkness and cold. Lift up your burden, it is God's gift, bear it nobly.

The man of letters whose voice is to prevail must be an optimist, and his voice often learns its message from his life. Stevenson's life has become a tradition only ten years after his death; he has taken his place among the heros, the bravest man of letters since Johnson and Lamb. I remember an hour when I was discouraged and ready to falter. For days I had been pegging away at a task which refused to get itself accomplished. In the midst of my perplexity I read an essay of Stevenson which made me feel as if I had been &quot;outing&quot; in the sunshine, instead of losing heart over a difficult task. I tried again with new courage and succeeded almost before I knew it. I have failed many times since; but I have never felt so disheartened as I did before that sturdy preacher gave me my lesson in the &quot;fashion of the smiling face.&quot;

Read Schopenhauer and Omar, and you will grow to find the world as hollow as they find it. Read Green's history of England, and the world is peopled with heroes. I never knew why Green's history thrilled me with the vigor of romance until I read his biography. Then I learned how his quick imagination transfigured the hard, bare facts of life into new and living dreams. When he and his wife were too poor to have a fire, he would sit before the unlit hearth and pretend that it was ablaze. &quot;Drill your thoughts,&quot; he said; &quot;shut out the gloomy and call in the bright. There is more wisdom in shutting one's eyes than your copybook philosophers will allow.&quot;

Every optimist moves along with progress and hastens it, while every pessimist would keep the worlds at a standstill. The consequence of pessimism in the life of a nation is the same as in the life of the individual. Pessimism kills the instinct that urges men to struggle against poverty, ignorance and crime, and dries up all the fountains of joy in the world. In imagination I leave the country which lifts up the manhood of the poor and I visit India, the underworld of fatalism —where three hundred million human beings, scarcely men, submerged in ignorance and misery, precipitate themselves still deeper into the pit. Why are they thus? Because they have for thousands of years been the victims of their philosophy, which teaches them that men are as grass, and the grass fadeth, and there is no more greenness on the earth. They sit in the shadow and let the circumstances they should master grip them, until they cease to be Men, and are made to dance and salaam like puppets in a play. After a little hour death comes and hurries them off to the grave, and other puppets with other &quot;pasteboard passions and desires&quot; take their place, and the show goes on for centuries.

Go to India and see what sort of civilization is developed when a nation lacks faith in progress and bows to the gods of darkness. Under the influence of Brahminism genius and ambition have been suppressed. There is no one to befriend the poor or to protect the fatherless and the widow. The sick lie untended. The blind know not how to see, nor the deaf to hear, and they are left by the roadside to die. In India it is a sin to teach the blind and the deaf because their affliction is regarded as a punishment for offenses in a previous state of existence. If I had been born in the midst of these fatalistic doctrines, I should still be in darkness, my life a desert-land where no caravan of thought might pass between my spirit and the world beyond.

The Hindoos believe in endurance, but not in resistance; therefore they have been subdued by strangers. Their history is a repetition of that Babylon. A nation from afar came with speed swiftly, and none stumbled, or slept, or slumbered, but they brought desolation upon the land, and took the stay and the staff from the people, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, and none delivered them. Woe, indeed, is the heritage of those who walk sad-thoughted and downcast through this radiant, soul delighting earth, blind to its beauty and deaf to its music, and of those who call evil good, and good evil, and put darkness for light, and light for darkness.

What care the weather-bronzed sons of the West, feeding the world from the plains of Dakota, for the Oars and the Brahmins? They would say to the Hindoos, &quot;Blot out your philosophy, dead for a thousand years, look with fresh eyes at Reality and Life, put away your Brahmins and your crooked gods, and seek diligently for Vishnu the Preserver.&quot;

Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement; nothing can be done without hope. When our forefathers laid the foundation of the American commonwealths, what nerved them to their task but a vision of a free community? Against the cold, inhospitable sky, across the wilderness white with snow, where lurked the hidden savage, gleamed the bow of promise, toward which they set their faces with the faith that levels mountains, fills up valleys, bridges rivers and carries civilization to the uttermost parts of the earth. Although the pioneers could not build according to the Hebraic ideal they saw, yet they gave the pattern of all that is most enduring in our country today. They brought to the wilderness the thinking mind, the printed book, the deep rooted desire for self-government and the English common law that judges alike the king and the subject, the law on which rests the whole structure of our society.

It is significant that the foundation of the law is optimistic. In Latin countries the court proceeds with a pessimistic bias. The prisoner is held guilty until he is proved innocent. In England and the United States there is an optimistic presumption that the accused is innocent until it is no longer possible to deny his guilt. Under our system, it is said, many criminals are acquitted; but it is surely better so than that many innocent persons should suffer. The pessimist cries, &quot;There is no enduring good in man! The tendency of all things is through perpetual loss to chaos in the end. If there was ever an idea of good in things evil, it was impotent, and the world rushes on to ruin.&quot; But behold, the law of the two most sober-minded, practical and law abiding nations on earth assumes the good in man and demands proof of the bad.

Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. The prophets of the world have been good of heart, or their standards would have stood naked in the field without a defender. Tolstoi's strictures lose power because they are pessimistic. If he had seen clearly the faults of America, and still believed in her capacity to overcome them, our people might have felt the stimulation of his censure. But the world turns its back on a hopeless prophet and listens to Emerson who takes in account the best qualities of the nation and attacks only the vices which no one can defend or deny. It listens to the strong man, Lincoln, who in times of doubt, trouble and need does not falter. He sees success afar, and by strenuous hope, by hoping against hope, inspires a nation. Through the night of despair he says, &quot;All is well,&quot; and thousands rest in his confidence. When such a man censures, and points to a fault, the nation obeys, and his words sink into the ears of men; but to the lamentations of the habitual Jeremiah the ear grows dull.

Our newspapers should remember this. The press is the pulpit of the modern world, and on the preachers who fill it much depends. If the protest of the press against unrighteous measures is to avail, then for ninety nine days the word of the preacher should be buoyant and of good cheer, so that on the hundredth day the voice of censure may be a hundred times strong. This was Lincoln's way. He knew the people; he believed in them and rested his faith on the justice and wisdom of the great majority. When in his rough and ready way he said, &quot;You can't fool all the people all the time,&quot; he expressed a great principle, the doctrine of faith in human nature.

The prophet is not without honor, save he be a pessimist. The ecstatic prophecies of Isaiah did far more to restore the exiles of Israel to their homes than the lamentations of Jeremiah did to deliver them from the hands of evil-doers.

Even on Christmas Day do men remember that Christ came as a prophet of good? His joyous optimism is like water to feverish lips, and has for its highest expression the eight beatitudes. It is because Christ is an optimist that for ages he has dominated the Western world. For nineteen centuries Christendom had gazed into his shining face and felt that all things work together for good. St. Paul, too, taught the faith which looks beyond the hardest things into the infinite horizon of heaven, where all limitations are lost in the light of perfect understanding. If you are born blind, search the treasures of darkness. They are more precious than the gold of Ophir. They are love and goodness and truth and hope, and their price is above rubies and sapphires.

Jesus utters and Paul proclaims a message of peace and a message of reason, a belief in the Idea, not in things, in love, not in conquest. The optimist is he who sees that men's actions are directed not by squadrons and armies, but by moral power, that the conquests of Alexander and Napoleon are less abiding than Newton's and Galileo's and St. Augustine's silent mastery of the world. Ideas are mightier than fire and sword. Noiselessly they propagate themselves from land to land, and mankind goes out and reaps the rich harvest and thanks God; but the achievements of the warrior are like his canvas city, &quot;to-day a camp, to-morrow all struck and vanished, a few pit-holes and heaps of straw.&quot; This was the gospel of Jesus two thousand years ago. Christmas Day is the festival of optimism.

Although there are still great evils which have not been subdued, and the optimist is not blind to them, yet he is full of hope. Despondency has no place in his creed, for he believes in the imperishable righteousness of God and the dignity of man. History records man's triumphant ascent. Each halt in his progress has been but a pause before a mighty leap forward. The time is not out of joint. If indeed some if the temples we worship in have fallen, we have built new ones on the sacred sites loftier and holier than those which have crumbled. If we have lost some of the heroic physical qualities of our ancestors, we have replaced them with a spiritual nobleness that turns aside wrath and binds up the wounds of the vanquished. All the past attainments of man are ours; and more, his day-dreams have become our clear realities. Therein lies our hope and sure faith.

As I stand in the sunshine if a sincere and earnest optimism, my imagination &quot;paints yet more glorious triumphs on the cloud-curtain of the future.&quot; Out of the fierce struggle and turmoil of contending systems and powers I see a brighter spiritual era slowly emerge —an era in which there shall be no England, no France, no Germany, no America, no this people or that, but one family, the human race; one law, peace; one need, harmony; one means, labor; one taskmaster, God.

If I should try to say anew the creed of the optimist, I should day something like this: &quot;I believe in God, I believe in man, I believe in the power of the spirit. I believe it is a sacred duty to encourage ourselves and others; to hold the tongue from any unhappy word against God's world, because no man has any right to complain of a universe which God made good, and which thousands of men have striven to keep good. I believe we should so act that we may draw nearer and more near the age when no man shall live at his ease while another suffers.&quot; These are the articles of my faith, and there is yet another on which all depends —to bear this faith above every tempest which overfloods it, and to make it a principal in disaster and through affliction. Optimism is the harmony between man's spirit and of God pronouncing His works good.

ESSAY II: ''Self-Reliance''

I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may contain. '''''To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, —that is genius.''''' Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—  and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility than most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

'''''There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance'''''; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.

'''''Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.''''' Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.

What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behaviour of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold, then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.

The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests: he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.

These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.

Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested,— &quot;But these impulses may be from below, not from above.&quot; I replied, &quot;They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil.&quot; No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, ‘Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it, —else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim. I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company. Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold Relief Societies; —though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.

Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.

What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blind-man's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new spontaneous word? Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean &quot;the foolish face of praise,&quot; the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease, in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face, with the most disagreeable sensation.

For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If this aversion had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.

The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.

But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.— 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' —Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.

I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; —read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing, contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.

There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm enough to-day to do right, and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn appearances, and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it which throws thunder into [[w:William Fitzhugh|Chatham]]'s voice, and dignity into [[w:George Washington|Washington]]'s port, and America into [[w:John Adams|Adams]]'s eye. Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage, because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.

I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you, and all men, and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design; —and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, [[w:Christian monasticism|Monachism]], of the [[w:Anthony the Great|Hermit Antony]]; the [[w:Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], of [[w:Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[w:Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], of [[w:George Fox|Fox]]; [[w:Methodism|Methodism]], of [[w:John Wesley|Wesley]]; [[w:Abolitionism|Abolition]], of [[w:Thomas Clarkson|Clarkson]]. [[w:Scipio Africanus|Scipio]], Milton called &quot;the height of Rome&quot;; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.

Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper, in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, ‘Who are you, Sir?’ Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince.

Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scanderbeg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men shall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.

The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.

The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving; —the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time, all mankind, —although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.

The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away, —means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it, —one as much as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and, in the universal miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear. If, therefore, a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.

Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say `I think,' `I am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.

This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see, —painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.

And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition. That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;——the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea, —long intervals of time, years, centuries, —are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.

Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric, when we speak of eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.

This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE. Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms. All things real are so by so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth. Power is in nature the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul.

Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within. Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.

But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius admonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool, how chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary! So let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and I have all men's. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say,— `Come out unto us.' But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. &quot;What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love.&quot;

If we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let us at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war, and wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts. This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check this lying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth's. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but proximities. I shall endeavour to nourish my parents, to support my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife, —but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men's, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last. —But so you may give these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me, and do the same thing.

The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the other of which we must be shriven. You may fulfil your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct, or in the reflex way. Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin, neighbour, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to myself. I have my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code. If any one imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day.

And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!

If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.

If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not `studying a profession,' for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, —and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.

It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their education; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association; in their property; in their speculative views.

1. In what prayers do men allow themselves! That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity, —any thing less than all good, —is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in Fletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,—

&quot;His hidden meaning lies in our endeavours;&lt;br/&gt;
Our valors are our best gods.&quot;

Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. &quot;To the persevering mortal,&quot; said Zoroaster, &quot;the blessed Immortals are swift.&quot;

As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, `Let not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will obey.' Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new mind is a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man's relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new terminology, as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind. But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see, —how you can see; `It must be somehow that you stole the light from us.' They do not yet perceive, that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it their own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.

2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of the earth. In manly hours, we feel that duty is our place. The soul is no traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still, and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet.

I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins.

Travelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.

3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It was in his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.

Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart, and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.

4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of society. All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves.

Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, something is taken. Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts. What a contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad axe, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his grave.

The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?

There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class. He who is really of their class will not be called by their name, but will be his own man, and, in his turn, the founder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in their fishing-boats, as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since. Columbus found the New World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery, which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before. The great genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor, and disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las Casas, &quot;without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries, and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his bread himself.&quot;

Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.

And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away from themselves and at things so long, that they have come to esteem the religious, learned, and civil institutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults on property. They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental, —came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him, has no root in him, and merely lies there, because no revolution or no robber takes it away. But that which a man is does always by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes. &quot;Thy lot or portion of life,&quot; said the Caliph Ali, &quot;is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.&quot; Our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers. The political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the concourse, and with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers summon conventions, and vote and resolve in multitude. Not so, O friends! will the God deign to enter and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.

So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.
