mediawiki namespace when it is introduced  i imagine that moving it to wikisource org wouldn t be too difficult either  i ll lave a message for brion about it    oldwikisource user angela angela   07 45  24 nov 2003  utc i thought that there would be something like  languagecode  wikisource org    oldwikisource user yann yann   20 41  24 nov 2003  utc you mean  this isn t the wikiberg project  smiles  but still  if the other parts are anything to go by  it should be should be wiki something  i m not sure  source  is right  though  apart from the software associations the word has on the net  the implication is that one has drawn information from it  that is  an older work is only a source for a work it is used for  all other documents appear in the bibliography  is this the intented use   we may need a  what wikiberg  b  is  b  page     oldwikisource user aliter aliter   00 19  25 nov 2003  utc ccc wait   wait   this project s name should be sourcewiki  to collate automatically with every other source related reference in people s bookmarks  favorites and lists  this is done naturally alphabetically by the first word  so that should be  source   source  is the topic  people are thinking of seeing available source text in various books  etc  other wiki s  e g  wardwiki  are like this  the name should not align with wikipedia  possibly chosen to resonate with  encyclopedia   wiki  suits the water people swim in  the medium they use reflexively  better than the water they drink  i think i ll have a  wiki  the site can stay at wikisource org if desired    oldwikisource user georgesawyer georgesawyer 22 49  22 apr 2004  utc    i m glad that you are not going to insist that we change direction  and that we don t need to change 36 000 articles   i can now relax with a good stiff scotch and wiki    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology 04 55  23 apr 2004  utc aim of the project    perhaps we already need a   oldwikisource what wikisource is not page   it s very new  and all discussion that i have seen about it envision it as a place for original sources   this does not qualify it as a dumping ground for lists that some people don t want on wikipedia   if the lists of zip codes and saints are to have any value they need to stay on wikipedia where they can be linked to the items in that list    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   08 18  24 nov 2003  utc i definitely miss the article of   oldwikisource what wikisource is   and any other pages which tell what kind of texts are to be included here  and what not   what is a   source    and give a definitive and obvious place to talk about it and shape its definitions if necessary for example i still have an idio h h h hguy who is annoying us on   hu   that he wants to create articles about fictional things  like   webcone   or the definition of   unarticulable future    among other proprietary nonsense   is wikisource is the media for him to publish his fictional ecyclopaedic material   gfdl   we definitely do not welcome these on the  real  wikipedia       oldwikisource user grin grin   12 19  1 dec 2003  utc you make a very good point   describing what something is not does depend a lot on what it is   i ll pay some attention to starting a page of that sort   i ve removed the   sp    from your comments  the word is correct     the idiot that you describe is not uniquely hungarian   they exist for all languages   i don t see wikisource as the place for the kind of material you describe any more than wikipedia   i mostly see wikisource as a series of reference texts which have usually been published somewhere else   these texts can also include tabular material or other statistical data   it is not a place for wikipedians to publish books that no sane publisher would accept   all of us would be happy to have thes fools go to somebody else s project   in some senses meta was devised to divert thes people  but perhaps they need their own project as a sort of asylum where they can be safely ignored        oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology 18 37  3 dec 2003  utc       although this is somewhat different  i ve long thought it would be nice for there to be a  dream wiki  where people could create wishlists for inventions  software  both those which compare features on existing products as well as what an idealized product would be able to do   as well as an arts clearinghouse for artistic ideas  e g   film or literature concepts  which could be shared for others to develop further  or even proposed solutions to political and social problems   the reason i think these would be ideal for wiki format is that people could have a centralized place to find out what has been envisioned on a given topic  and even give opportunities for innovation and possibly collaboration   although things might get unclear where opinions could seem inherently conflicting  the primary aim would not be to delete ideas  but to organize them by topic   this would in my view also ideally be subtly linked from wikipedia for those wishing to find the corresponding innovation ideas page for a given topic under research as it could be of interest to the researcher    oldwikisource user brettz9 brettz9   04 20  26 jul 2004  utc have you guys heard of project gutenberg  how do your aims differ from theirs  there seems to be alot of overlap   maybe you could integrate your efforts    steve   this has been discussed earlier  see   oldwikisource wikisource wikisource and project gutenberg you are welcome to comment further on that page  if you feel that you have something to add to the discussion        oldwikisource user christian s christian s   17 29  11 jun 2004  utc what about music texts   i d like a repository of scores  pdf perhaps    is there a category for this  or another wiki  or can we make one     geoff     languages is this like meta  one wiki but offical many languages  or like wiktionary  only english for now  for other languages there must be setup new wiki s    oldwikisource user walter walter   08 54  24 nov 2003  utc i think it s too new to tell   personally  i have no problem with source texts in multiple languages  but i would wait to see how the discussions go    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   09 44  24 nov 2003  utc it would be dumb not to have it like meta  all languages should be welcome  just use naming conventions to disambiguate  language category tags can later be used to set the language of an anon user s interface  preferences can also be set to change the language of logged in users  of course this will take time to code  i still don t think there is a enough meat to this project for it to be an interesting and viable place  why is it necessary to edit public domain texts from projects like distributed proofreaders  and since such editing is necessary  and in fact harmful   then what is the point  much better just to concentrate on educationally important public domain texts and put them in wikibooks      oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   19 47  24 nov 2003  utc i would like to put some french texts here  do we make special home page for each languages like http   wikibooks org wiki main page français     oldwikisource user yann yann   20 45  24 nov 2003  utc   it would be very dumb  to have it like meta  all languages should be welcome  but like in wikipedia it does not make much sense to intersperse malayan en gaelic documents  as you can see from the french example  the first thing to do for a new language is creating a non general part  what sense is there in keeping these combined then  it will just cause a need for cross translation of every project page  without adding anything    oldwikisource user aliter aliter   00 19  25 nov 2003  utc sources are sources are sources  do you intend to create your own translations  that would   not   be a source  what about old or even middle english  should those have their own wikis as well  where do we put the original chaucer  have you read the original chaucer  it isn t what i would call english   looks more like a cross between latin and low german  the reason why wikipedia is so segmented is because of naming conflicts  articles on albert einstein will require that exact same title is a great many languages  sources will be given their original title names  whatever that language is  if there happens to be a public domain translation  then that translated title would be the page name  simple  clean and inclusive       oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   03 15  25 nov 2003  utc ok but how to have a localised menu    oldwikisource user yann yann   15 44  25 nov 2003  utc i think localised menus are a great idea  perhaps the current main page should be moved to   oldwikisource main page english   and   oldwikisource main page be made more of an international portal linking to the localised versions    oldwikisource user angela angela   23 05  25 nov 2003  utc sounds good to me      oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   23 06  25 nov 2003  utc that is going to require 1  a good category system  in the works   just some bugs to fix  2  the creation of language category tags  3  the ability of mediawiki to have multiple language php files for one wiki  4  a user preference to set the interface language  then anons visiting a page with a language category tag set to  french  will have his or her interface language change to french  a logged in user could override that and have everything in whatever language we have language php files for  now we need a developer to code that  but it seems like it wouldn t be too much work once we have a functioning category system      oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   23 06  25 nov 2003  utc i m sorry to disagree  but no  sources  in the sense of that what we take data from  aren t really that different from the wikipedia  like wikipedia texts  sources about albert einstein tend to be called  albert einstein  and the language wikipedias have the effect of not offering chinese pages to the danes  which is a feature most people would want for sources as well   not to say no danes read chinese  but those that do will look for chinese pages sources themselves   and yes  in the sense mentioned above  the translated version of an original can indeed be the source for articles in the language of the translation       we really do need that  what is  page     oldwikisource user aliter aliter   04 32  26 nov 2003  utc everything moved from ps i probably should have clarified this yesterday  but all that happened last night is that   all   the articles from ps wikipedia were moved here  this was done to clean up what ought to be pashto wikipedia  the movement of them here did not involve any editorial decisions and it does not reflect a view that those articles should stay here  it was just easier to get them moved in one go  later  when we have some policies here  we can decide what needs to be done with them  most of them have not been edited since their move here  so they all need work  if not deletion    right  it wouldn t do to have the afghans angry with us there are a number of things which need to be decided     project sourceberg what wikisource is not   is probably a good place to start  we also need to decide whether to stick with the name project sourceberg  or to go with wikisource  or wikisource  or something else entirely  i was assuming it was international and we already have articles in latin  polish  french and german  but that decision is another one which will need to be made    oldwikisource user angela angela 19 24  24 nov 2003  utc     the project sourceberg wikisource naming issue should be at the top of the list  before the project gets so big that a change will imply moving a lot more articles   i very much favour the latter name as consistent with the naming conventions used on other projects   that consistent approach will help the public to associate any  wiki xxx  with the wikimedia   perhaps even the 9 11 project could be changed to  wikimorial  to leave it room to evolve into something that also honours victims of other tragedies    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   21 28  24 nov 2003  utc agreed on priority and on the wikimorial idea  though i m not sure about the  morial  bit  alternatives  and who will have to be persuaded   as mentioned before  i m not sure about  source  since the open bit is already implied in  wiki  can we simply be  wikitext s  unless we take pictures too  in which case we d be  wikimedia  oops    oldwikisource user aliter aliter   00 19  25 nov 2003  utc ditto ec  i kinda like the  wikimorial  name   at least as a working title  however beware of working titles  wikibooks  was a working title that stuck  i would have liked  wikiveristy  better  i also don t think that  wikibooks  is a trademarkable name   there are many uses of that term prior to the project s founding   so it is best to have unique names  wikisource and wikimorial fit that bill       oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149       links how to make a link to here from another wikipedia projects  and the  nowiki  numberofarticles  nowiki  doesn t seem to work  i added 4 articles and the cound didn t change    oldwikisource user yann yann   21 22  24 nov 2003  utc domain names     http   wikisource org and http   wikisource com forward here now  your isp s dns server may not be updated yet  however      oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149 06 41  25 nov 2003  utc another thing that should be decided is whether this project is wanted at all  people may well have been bugging brion for it  but on the other hand  there are still a lot of people arguing that this stuff should be on wikipedia  the polish wikipedia have created a new namespace for source texts  if people are going to oppose the movement of source texts from wikipedia to here  which they are doing at en   how is it going to work  or should the   en wp wwin wikipedia is not a repository for source texts   rule just be more strictly imposed    oldwikisource user angela angela 10 49  25 nov 2003  utc    does that mean such a discussion should be put on meta s current issues list   actually  more a discussion about all of  what goes where  judging by the remarks on this page     oldwikisource user aliter aliter   04 32  26 nov 2003  utc speeches now that it exists  i think that this project is a more appropriate place for full speeches than wikiquote  and that they should be moved here rather than the other way around  as suggested in a comment on the main page    oldwikisource user kalki kalki   17 13  25 nov 2003  utc i moved the comment off the main page  they would be better here than wikiquote i think    oldwikisource user angela angela   03 35  26 nov 2003  utc multi language front page though this page has become the general  english  discussion page  this is also where i land when trying to comment explicitely on the main page  should the main page be single language until we know what this wiki will be  this would give meta wiki the time to sort out the wikipedia front page issue    oldwikisource user aliter aliter 04 42  26 nov 2003  utc    maybe we can add an option in preferences and let user decide which language wikisource s he would like to see      oldwikisource user samuel samuel 10 08  26 nov 2003  utc category     i think it s necessary to make the main page an index as wikipedia does  i can hardly image when the current main page growing longer and longer      oldwikisource user samuel samuel 10 08  26 nov 2003  utc   i agree   there has been talk at wikipedia for some time now about introducing a category scheme which can hopefully also be adapted to this project   a table of contents is another thing  and is probably what you meant   the entire project will indeed become unworkable if links to every entry are on the main page   the primary link will be the one created by the contributor when he begins his contribution   this needs to be an idiot proof system that virtually guarantees that the entry will be linked from the right place   in some ways this is made easier by the fact that there for the immediately forseeable future  each individual contribution will have fewer links though that too will change when interwiki links are more functional   it is made more complicated and challenging by the decision  which i accept  that there should be a single multi language wikisource project    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology 19 22  27 nov 2003  utc page titles     the naming of pages is an issue that must be addressed soon  i added 3 essays with the authors name followed by a dash and then the essay title  but now think that perhaps just the title should be used until actual conflicts arise  and then have the title followed by the authors name  or have the title followed by the author on all compositions   i am refraining from further additions for now  and await others ideas on the matter    oldwikisource user kalki kalki 13 12  26 nov 2003  utc   i see someone els e has added essays with title followed by author  and i do believe this probably is the best format for all literary works and speeches    oldwikisource user kalki kalki   13 22  26 nov 2003  utc isn t that what s doing in english wikipedia  unless there are some texts having the same names  we have no need to use title like    name title    imho  using    title  name     would be a good idea to disambiguate the two texts with the same names  and  disambiguation pages are needed sometimes      oldwikisource user samuel samuel   02 40  28 nov 2003  utc i agree to the principal entry being under the title with the author being used in the title in cases where it is necessary for disambiguation or to expand generic titles such as poetry of      essays of      etc  which tend to be inherently ambiguous   a further language indicator may be needed when we have the work in several languages   the absence of a language indicator woould tell us that the work is in its original language   the main english page  and those for other languages  now have links to articles in that language based on a   prima facie   division of categories   i think that we can easily agree that this will very soon outgrow the main page   the main page should then have links to broad entry reference pages   ultimately every substantive contribution    must    link through or be traceable to one of these pages   the first that i would want to establish is   oldwikisource wikisource authors for all works attributable to a personal author   a primary division of this first level listing by genres is not helpful   some authors used several genres  and it is most helpful to put an authors works together in one place   sometimes a user may simply not be aware that a famous work is in a genre other than what he might expect   the   iliad   and   odyssey  were written in verse  but many may only be familiar with prose translations of these works   other top level categories will soon be evident   i hope to say more as my ideas develop    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   02 58  30 nov 2003  utc poetry    it would perhaps be best to create pages for each author and only afterwards  if necessary  create seperate pages for longer works    oldwikisource user kalki kalki i agree  and sometimes maybe we need to create separate pages for each chapter   using slash         oldwikisource user samuel samuel 02 33  28 nov 2003  utc     classical texts i m very new at this whole thing  and i hope i haven t misunderstood the whole purpose of this project   but still  i was surprised that on the main page here there was no category for  classical texts  this is what i initially thought the whole project was about  allowing people to write introductions and commentaries to texts  to provide study aids  etc   and perhaps most important of all  for primary texts that are english translations from classical languages such as greek  hebrew  latin   to allow for the free update of what are largely outdated public domain translations   examples  homer  classical philosophy  e g  aristotle   etc if people agree with what i ve written here  then perhaps we can add a  classical texts  category   oldwikisource user zabek zabek   07 20  30 nov 2003  utc yes  definitely   add it  the project only started a few days ago which is why they aren t there yet    oldwikisource user angela angela   08 21  30 nov 2003  utc ok  then i ll add it   maybe actually in three categories  ancient and classical texts medieval texts early modern texts would people agree to this   oldwikisource user zabek zabek   13 41  30 nov 2003  utc wikibooks is where study aids and annotations go      oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   19 16  3 dec 2003  utc wikibooks  if i understand correctly  is for   schoolbooks    i e  for textbooks and for the kinds of literary texts that everybody has to buy and read in high school or college   so shakespeare belongs there too  because it is required reading   and maybe other things that are often on teachers  reading lists  or for which there are cliff notes   but most other texts   don t   belong there  they belong here  again  if i have understood correctly    how have other people understood this issue   oldwikisource user zabek zabek 11 29  4 dec 2003  utc    yep  although wikibooks aims to add value to shakespeare by adding annotation  in the future it would be real nice to be able to export the content of wikisource s version of shakespeare s works to wikibooks  we already do something similar for the wikimedia foundation website  the source file for http   wikimediafoundation org fundraising is at   meta wikimedia fundraising page that way wikisource can concentrate on providing authoritative sources and wikibooks can concentrate on annotating educationally significant sources  along with creating study guides and textbooks       oldwikisource user maveric149 maveric149   18 20  4 dec 2003  utc i think i got it    oldwikisource user yann yann   12 46  4 dec 2003  utc if i would change something in the pd editions of latin texts  e g  m   marcus  in stead of m    manius   which is now generally accepted as correction of the annals of tacitus  would this violate the copyright of the authors who proposed this correction  in this case r  syme   because i have mentioned in my dutch translation of the annales references to some works that helped me with my translation   oldwikisource nederlandse vertaling van de annales verantwoording vertaling 1     it would be handy if the pd texts can be  updated  to the modern interpretation of the text     oldwikisource user evil berry evil berry      top level category for treaties etc i suggest a general category of  special documents  for what is now  treaties  pacts  legal texts  and declarations   also  i think  essays  is too general  already covered in other categories   oldwikisource user zabek zabek   14 48  2 dec 2003  utc i will follow what you suggest  i am not an expert in this domain    oldwikisource user yann yann   15 03  2 dec 2003  utc i ve been puzzling over this one myself  special  seems too general  since there are many ways to be special   my current thinking tends toward  historic documents  but i don t feel completely firm about this   the one thing now there which i feel does not belong is the eurovision song material which has dubious importance beside all the others     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   18 27  2 dec 2003  utc i ve done a bit more restructuring for the approach to linkage on the main english page   the left half gives primary categories  and in theory every source document in wikisource should be able to link back to the main page through one of these categories   they have also been put into a logical order based on a series of questions in the form  does it belong here  if not go to the next question  the final category is  none of the above  which is also a default category   other categories may be added later when the need arises   i still need to break off pages for some of the categories   the right half i ve called  secondary indexes  inclusion in any of these is optional   i don t expect to work on the remaining items here until i ve finished with the left side    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   00 04  4 dec 2003  utc i agree     treaties    needs to be a major category  there are a rather lot of them  and they are quite large  i would then propose that the rest be called something like    documents of governance    being laws  constitutions and court rulings   humm  maybe    court rulings    would need to be a major heading someday too        oldwikisource user paulinsaudi paulinsaudi   17 14  1 may 2004  utc one of the things that i m trying to avoid is too many top level primary categories  several that are already there should probably be moved away from there   the reasonable argument about  treaties  could be made about a lot of other things with the result that the main page would soon become unwieldy   historical documents  though a different comprehensive name could possibly be found  covers a broad range of texts  and  treaties  is best treated as a sub heading from there    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   17 44  1 may 2004  utc link to wikipedia main page    does anyone know why this english main page for wikisource is   not   linked to the english wikipedia main page    under  sister projects  is it possible to put it there    i know the main page is only supposed to be touched very carefully      oldwikisource user zabek zabek   04 31  5 dec 2003  utc i did suggest it at    en talk main page   and got no reply  i shall take no reply to be agreement and try adding it       oldwikisource user angela angela 22 17  5 dec 2003  utc      please note translations there s currently quite a few documents here not in the language they were written in   these don t count in their own right as primary source document  but are instead   translations   of primary source documents   thus  they should be labeled as such  and the translator should preferably be noted  and whether the translation is an official one or not    the   oldwikisource constitution des états unis d amérique french version of the us constitution   and the   oldwikisource the constitution of japan 1946 english version of the japanese constitution are two good examples   this has two purposes  it lets people know whether a translation is   the   translation  or just   a   translation  and it lets people know that the document isn t really a primary source text in its own right      oldwikisource user delirium delirium   03 08  6 dec 2003  utc there s a question or whether texts translated by  us  belong here  even with a note   perhaps they belong on wikibooks in some form   personally  i think they should belong here  appropriately noted as you say   this definitely needs to be clarified in   project sourceberg what wikisource is not   or   project sourceberg what wikisource is once it s been decided       oldwikisource user spikey spikey   13 50  11 dec 2003  utc i have no problem with having translations of works in this project  though equally strong cases could be made for having these at wikibooks   my primary delineation between the two projects is that this one is for the works themselves  while wikibooks is    about    the works   we will probably have a lot of cases where the work that appears at wikisource is not here in the original language   as long as the fact is clearly stated that should be fine  the original can be added later   having the gandhi works appear in the original gujarati alone wouldn t help many people   my own work on a master index has been with the distinction between originals firmly in mind   i agree that the names of who translated something should be recorded  and if a translation is an original one by a wikimedian that two should be recorded  an original translation by default would be subject to gfdl   translations are derivative works for copyright purposes  and there are many instances where the original is in the public domain  but the translation is not the reference to the american and japanese constitutions is interesting   these are only official in the languages of those countries   no translation of them has official status  there is no such thing as    the    translation    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   18 20  11 dec 2003  utc hi  i believe that this translation comes from http   usinfo state gov usa infousa facts funddocs constfr htm  so i would see it as an offical translation    oldwikisource user yann yann   10 37  12 dec 2003  utc it may be an excellent translation from a reliable source  but that still does not make it  official  for legal purposes   you could not go into an american court and make a legal argument about a constitutional issue based on any translation into any other language    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   11 23  12 dec 2003  utc i mean  official  not from a lawyer pov  but a

149 170   03 03  27 jan 2004  utc there has already been much discussion of this on the mailing list and elsewhere  and the proposal has broad support   the matter is in the hands of the technical gurus       which i am not    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   17 31  1 may 2004  utc moved from my talk page changes to the english main page        i would really appreciate it if you discussed your plans before you went ahead and started rearranging things on the english main page to suit yourself     ec well  it is not a   wikipedia protected page protected page   and this is a   wikipedia wiki wiki after all  meaning that there is no need to discuss changes before performing them  by the way  i don t know why do you think i m doing it to suit myself  after all  i m giving it a more user friendly  easy to access and live environment similar to   wikipedia main page wikipedia s main page    peace out      oldwikisource user maio maio 22 06  7 feb 2004  utc    if you want we could place a vote for the different styles  i think that s the best approach         oldwikisource user maio maio 22 25  7 feb 2004  utc   of course it s not a protected page  and i certainly would not support that it become a protected page in the near future   the wikipedia main page has been protected because it was attracting a lot of common vandals  this was making life difficult for everybody   the simple fact that a page is not protected is not alone a valid excuse for doing something to the page that would totally change its character   so yes you can edit it the way you want  but then so can anybody else   that s what edit wars are made of there may be no adopted rule that requires discussing a change before performing it  but doing so can be a breach of wikiquette  especially when the page in question is fundamental to the overall operation to a major part of the project   whether your changes made the page more user friendly and easier to access is debatable  and i don t know what you mean by  live environment  as for votes  no thanks   votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions   it prevents alternative third solutions   if you were more willing to express what is important to you in those changes  a compromise might more easily be reached   not all aspects of that page are equally important to me     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology 09 24  8 feb 2004  utc     as you have stated yourself  the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions  i beleive that it is completely unnecessary to move the discussion here  because of that  i have replied on   oldwikisource user talk eclecticology your talk page   instead      oldwikisource user maio maio 19 20  8 feb 2004  utc      maio s comments on my talk page to tell you the truth  i don t understand why  you  don t like the changes  i m kinda tired of this childish feeling that i have by playing sherlock holmes with you  trying to guess out what you don t like  right now it looks like you are circumvilating the debate  instead of attacking it already  maybe you could be more specific and to the point  please pretty sir        you see  if you don t like a change  you should at least provide a reason of why you don t like it  stating that you are reverting it because it is an  undiscussed change  or because you are  restoring primary categories  when they were never removed  is kinda vague  which  btw  makes it hard to adjust it in order to be gratifying let me try to guess what you may be looking for     sigh   deep breath  blockquote  index  obvious  easy to access menu that should be at the very top of the page  right after the introduction     new texts  providing a living environment to the page by living i mean something with a constant internal change  but with an external layout that remains the same  mdash  think of the human body or the wikipedia main page  especifically the  selected articles  section      quick reference help  just a layout change  the text pretty much remains the same i don t know why it is titled  primary categories  when it is indeed a  quick reference help  similar to windows s help      community  providing quick reference help pages just like in the wikipedia main page  blockquote  i don t understand why you moved this to   oldwikisource talk main page english    especially after you have expressed that this is a debate between 2 users only  i m here to work on a consensus  not on a conflict between us  if find it completely unnecessary to justify the changes  but just so you know  the reason why i changed it again was because of   oldwikisource user ashley y and your comment on   oldwikisource talk main page peace out        oldwikisource user maio maio 19 20  8 feb 2004  utc      reply i did not express that this was a debate between two users   i said  votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions  perhaps i should rephrase it to  votes stifle consensus by reducing the entire debate to two opposing position  this is not just a matter affecting two users  but one affecting everybody s relation to the project  or at least to its english part    putting it on personal talk pages means that fewer people will see it   i have nothing to hide in my views   yes ashley did express preference to your version as it was at the time   my comments at the time referred only to the  coloured bullets  which i was happy to see all black   my main concern on this page is the  primary categories  which i view as the top end of a site map   i don t at all see how it can be analogous to a  windows help  page   i would say the same thing about it as you do about the index  obvious  easy to access menu that should be at the very top of the page  right after the introduction  i mostly do not touch what is now called the  index  its maintenance is irregular  and its divisions are subjective   neverthess i avoid interfering with what people put there   there is very little dispute about the contents of  new texts  and  quick reference help   community  although we may differ about their relative placements on the page     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   20 42  8 feb 2004  utc ps  you are evidently more comfortable with the use of html than i   if some agreement can be reached  implementing it may be easier for you     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   21 07  8 feb 2004  utc ahhh   so that s it  ok  how about this  we can set the index and the quick reference help at the top  for example  check out   oldwikisource main page espanol    correct me if i m wrong  but in the case of   oldwikisource main page espanol you would like the  primary categories  where  textos nuevos  is located  give me some time  i m on linux right now and don t have my tools here      oldwikisource user maio maio   00 34  9 feb 2004  utc not exactly  but close   i would switch the positions of  indice  and  primary categories  textos nuevos  y  communidad  would be fine where you have them    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   02 07  9 feb 2004  utc new format part of the original discussion was moved to   oldwikisource wikisource scriptorium please check out the new format of the main page in english  btw  if we set the table width to  100  that s would be too wide  80  is appropriate      oldwikisource user samuel samuel   02 51  9 feb 2004  utc i ve switched places between  primary categories  and  other indexes  read the  top level category  section above for the rationale of what i m trying to do   i think that the headings in what has been called  index  are not designed to be comprehensive   i think that the index section can be useful for creating a lot of different specialized indexes   i also found that reducing the overall width to 80  made the half width sections too narrow    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   07 49  9 feb 2004  utc in terms of  different specialized indexes  i just moved stuff up one level   this is much more useful than just  texts  and it can help new viewers get a sense of the broad  vast potential of a great site like this    in general  i think the new mainpage is really nice  both visually and in terms of usefulness   those who worked on it did a great job     oldwikisource user zabek zabek   07 52  23 feb 2004  utc   hr  tables are usually set to a full width  100   because there are users who browse in low screen resolutions  for example  it may seem huge for someone running under 1600x1200  but for those running on 800x600  setting the width to 80  takes away a considerable amount of screen space     just fyi  so that you understand the reasoning behind it  college students that use computers that are property of the campus  browse at a 800x600 resolution usually  1600x1200 is rare  i think the last stadistic was 5    a few years ago  the common resolution was 640x480  now it is 800x600  with 1024x768 as the next  standard  at its pace  it will be the most common in less than 2 years probably          oldwikisource user maio maio 02 46  10 feb 2004  utc consensus format of   oldwikisource main page english well  i think we finally got it all resolved  hoorj          oldwikisource user maio maio   02 46  10 feb 2004  utc great   i hope samuel will agree     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   03 34  10 feb 2004  utc it looks nice         oldwikisource user samuel samuel   01 48  11 feb 2004  utc updating   a while back it was agreed that we should have  new texts  links as part of the main page   it would be nice if the proponents of that feature made an effort to maintain it    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   05 18  11 apr 2004  utc licenses    i have an idea for a new category  licenses  this category could contain the gfdl  gpl  lesser gpl  freebsd license  and microsoft s eula  etc   good idea   bad idea   am i completely insane    oldwikisource user supadawg supadawg   00 56  6 may 2004  utc that actually seems like a good idea  but i m not sure if licenses themselves are copyrighted  off course  the gpl isn t  but i m not to sure on the ms eula  if licenses allow it  great idea  it could be used for all sorts of comparison and research      oldwikisource user 80 57 134 174 80 57 134 174   10 42  19 sep 2004  utc primary categories section     this should not be in question answer form with a section for each question  it just ends up repeating the same phrase over and over  and overcompicating the view of the front page   probably would look nicer delimited by    like in wikipedia  or just as a bulleted list   as a side note  it might be nice to add a  featured text  or something to make good use of the front page  while still linking to the categories     oldwikisource user siroxo siroxo 02 13  5 jun 2004  utc      mathematical vs  numerical i think it is misleading that the question asks whether is mathematical when really it is referring to being numerical  i think the page should be changed to numerical rather than mathematical  for example  i don t think euclid s elements would fall under that category even though it may be purely mathematical oldwikisource user cronian cronian   06 23  29 jun 2004  utc i understand your point   what i like about  mathematical  is that it is a broader term  despite the fact that the subject has been dominated by numerical charts and tables   tables of integrals are a conceivable inclusion   euclid s elements would likely have been included under the author    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   08 01  29 jun 2004  utc public patents      i wouldn t myself be inclined to develop these pages  as i d have no idea what to do about it   but i noticed that the category of public patents  if such things exist  as i have heard they do   would be a nice  logical addition to this site and set of sites    oldwikisource user brettz9 brettz9 04 09  26 jul 2004  utc   including the material available should be a fine afternoon s work   the uspto has all this on line  and it s only 4 terabytes long   it is still missing the material that was lost in the fire of 1836 12 15   see http   www uspto gov patft index html    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology 00 13  27 jul 2004  utc     i wasn t sure if you understand that by public patents i was referring to patents which were kind of anti patents or gpl type of things for inventions   by the way  eclecticology  did you see my response to your older posting in section 2 above    oldwikisource user brettz9 brettz9 06 38  30 jul 2004  utc     thanks for pointing out your earlier comments  i had not noticed them before   your idea is certainly interesting and with tremendous possibilities   admittedly life on the wiki has made me far more familiar with copyright law than with patent law   perhaps too the fact that i recently acquired the book    the smoking gun   may have put me in an unfair mood   it mentions such things as u s  patent 5 472 399  an apparatus for exercising the penis  and patent 5 934 226  a diaper for pet birds  i have no problem supporting the principle that you express  it is certainly visionary   i still don t know what the right wiki project would be for it  but ultimately  once it gets off the ground  it would deserve a project of its own  i have always maintained that the public domain signifies not an absence of ownership  but an ownership by the public   patents have a much shorter lifespan than copyritghts   henson s 1842 patent of the airfoil was well into the public domain but the time the wright brothers were ready for their first flight   i guess my point with that is that a free patent regime depends far more on what has gone before than is the case with open copyrights   patents need to be reviewed before being granted  and  at least in theory  that includes checking to see if the idea duplicates a previously patented idea   i think that there is a lot of room for challenging some patents  but unless the challenger personally has a vested interest it just won t happen   would the previous invention of a poop bag for dogs have prevented the patent of the bird diaper that i mentioned  also  the fact that something is patented does not prevent you from using the description to make a model for your own use  it only prevents you from marketting the product and using it to derive profit to be successful this idea must emphasize what people can do for themselves   i am curious about what message they are trying to communicate in a tv ad when they describe their product as  patented  how is that possibly going to make that product work better  or be better suited for its purpose   what con game are they playing   what are the ingredients in a can of commercial paint thinner that you get at a hardware store   leaving aside questions of poisons and carcinogens  is there something that i could mix myself for a lot cheaper that could do the job more easily   i hope you get my point       i seem to be ranting on in the gospel of self reliance   consumerism relies on personal incompetance  including the inability of the average man of the house to perform the most elementary of household repairs   public patents that provide a practical guide to overcoming this defect could be very welcome    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   19 56  2 sep 2004  utc changes to layout       oldwikisource user aaronsw aaronsw s changes were rightly reverted since they were quite radical and not discussed beforehand at all   i think the   oldwikisource main page   is great the way it is and i wasn t a fan of what he did to the author template either  but i did like  http   wikisource org w wiki phtml title main page english  oldid 15594 his way  of organizing the english main page   therefore i would like to discuss if we could organize the categories the way he did  i e  more succinctly and structured   personally i think it gives the reader more options to find what they want faster   obviously he didn t go about it the right way but anyone else agree that the english main page looked better the new way      oldwikisource user biggins biggins 11 01  2 sep 2004  utc    the intent in structuring the english main page the way that it is was based on a decision tree that would allow the placement of any article   at least the left half has been that way   it allows any and all articles to be traced back to the main page    i ve taken very little interest in the right half  even though i ve noticed that some of the new articles remain new for a very long time    the thinking behind it has you begin at the top of the list  ask the question  and if the answer is yes put the article under that heading  if no go on to the next question   at the end of the series of questions you reach  none of the above  i admit that i have been remiss in properly documenting that process   the word  categories  at the head of that box was there long before the current category system was devised  and may now be misleading    oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   20 13  2 sep 2004  utc this kind of decision tree would be more appropriate on a  how to add an article  page  people want to find articles in all sorts of ways  and the front page should be geared to them      ok now i know what the questions were for  i never understood     but as aaronsw says  a decision tree would probably be more appropriate on something like the   how to submit a text page  while a more index like layout would be better for the main page in my opinion   and really  the substance doesnt really change much  the proposed version contains all the links that are on the current version  only organized differently and adding links to category like pages    wikisource letters letters      wikisource poetry poetry etc    all pages could still be traced back to the main page  in fact more of them  the category like pages  could      as for the misleading categories header  i agree its a bit outdated   i for one completely forgot about   oldwikisource wikisource poetry the poetry page when i added   oldwikisource the hunting of the snark    i just listed it from lewis carroll s author page and thought i was done   linking to a document from multiple places like that seems annoying and unnecessary  shouldn t we make those true categories so we can just put a  nowiki  category poetry  nowiki  link on a page      oldwikisource user biggins biggins   00 13  3 sep 2004  utc ooh boy  just went back and read through the whole discussion about categories at the scriptorium   so are we officially using the library of congress system or what   i m kinda confused about the whole issue      oldwikisource user biggins biggins   00 29  3 sep 2004  utc relegating something to a  how to add an article  page would be a ticket to oblivion   there is plenty of room for both approches on the english main page  that has always been the case   the most important feature about the  primary categories  and i m now considering changing that title to  primary links  is that it is comprehensive    i e    absolutely every article can be linked through it   no one is obliged to link from multiple places  linking from an author page is quite sufficient   if someone wants to make an additional link from the poetry page they are welcome to do it  though eventually any good category system should make such pages based on genre redundant   my suggestion at this point would be for those who want change to develop the right side of the page to their satisfaction   i m not likely to take a significant role in that exercise   when that is done  perhaps we can better co ordinate our different efforts there is nothing obligatory or even  official  about using the library of congress classification system  lc    nor is there anything to prevent or forbid multiple category systems   nevertheless  if someone wants to start another coded system they would do well to insure that all their categories are clearly identified as being from that system   to the extent that the lc system is used here  it has already been much modified  and has thus only served as a general guideline for a coded structure   to make a long story short  a significant part of the rationale for a coded system was to enable  categories  or  subjects  in multiple languages that would redirect to a common code   thus  poetry    poésie    poesia  etc  could all redirect to class  pne  oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   08 42  3 sep 2004  utc i m a believer in trying things out myself to get other people interested in them  if i make mistakes  people are inspired by learning from them  if i happen to possibly have a good idea  people are inspired to take that into account and improve upon it with their own ideas  it was for that reason that i ve spent a couple of fun hours working on   oldwikisource user icurite mainpage my attempt at a main page   while i surfed around the place  hopefully  both the strengths and more likely the weaknesses of my design will inspire some further discussion and possibly even some action i do strongly feel  however  that categories need to be used more  just like i add uncategorized articles to categories at wikipedia  i also do the same here  and i also agree with another comment i read on this talk page that the main page needs to become more of a general internet resource rather than a contributor s resource    oldwikisource user icurite icurite       external linking i have a question about linking out to outside pages where sources are stored  can we put links to the sites with these sources or do we only allow for wikisource stored content i understand that we would like to make the texts available on wikisource site  this way anybody can access them right here  but then there are thousands of texts which are available to read and download but have restrictions as far as publishing is concerned   one example is the university of virginia electronic resources  there are great many etexts there but the publisher does not allow for them to be re published without permision  see http   etext lib virginia edu conditions html but instead of taking their etexts and publishing them on wikisource  we could of course create links to good sources where the etexts are kept   to give you one example  i added a book for wikisource author   oldwikisource author horatio alger horatio alger oldwikisource ragged dick  or  street life in new york    this link  instead of leading to the text on wikisource  directs to virginia university collection  you might say that it is better to have the text on wiki  but then some texts are not available because of copywright reasons  directing to external sources allows us to have authors  collection more complete what do you think      oldwikisource user aiks aiks   18 55  3 sep 2004  utc when dealing with issues of this sort one needs to distinguish between what is not allowed  and what is merely not recommended   clear violations of copyright without adequate justification should clearly not be allowed   duplicating material that is easily found elsewhere is not recommended   in general i have no problem with linking  but i would find it useless and disappointing if the    only    work that we mentioned by an author linked to an outside source    alger was a prolific author  and you are obviously interested in his work   your point about having a more complete collection is absolutely valid   developing a good bibliography of his works on the author page certainly fits well with my own vision of this project   researching the availability of material is a part of bibliographic work  and uva texts do tend to be in a format that is consistent with the way we would like to present things to our readers   contrast this with those sites that have pdf files  or images  or are non searchable  or filled with ads   of course  if we want to do more than carry a bare text  adding such features as links to wiktionary  having the text in our databse would be essential    but were not there     yet as to uva s terms of use  i find much of what they say to be   ultra vires     they have no way of legally preventing you from using that part of their texts which is already in the public domain   their scanning and proofreading work is not copyrightable   some of their added material may be  but we re not interested in that anyway     oldwikisource user eclecticology eclecticology   01 30  4 sep 2004  utc logo suggestion see    oldwikisource wikisource revising the  sourceberg  logo        index should be given top priority as this is supposed to be a resource for everyone  not just for contributors  i think the index should

gfdl  but it wasn t a university paper  just an old highschool assignment   i m not very familiar with how things work on wikisource   would it be beneficial to submit it  would others be able to edit

good things to start with  we want things that have been made widely available to the public   in your case  it would not be advised to submit those essays here   we ve had wikisource users submit their own writings before  and each entry has been deleted   the same would happen in your case  too   if you would like to publish your essays  i advise another place  such as  http   www fictionpress com fictionpress com    that site is more designed for what you want  and there are ways for you to attract people to read the essays you post there  also     oldwikisource user

community portal section    a     is below the fold    b     has content more appropriate for the under developed  community portal  page  i think the community portal page is very undeveloped considering the continued growth of wikisource  i know the community page does not the need quite the scale and size of the wikipedia version  and to be honest i don t think the wp page it s very usable unless you re used to it   but does anyone object to some general improvements of the cp page  perhaps containing some of the main page community links    oldwikisource user gregrobson

therefore the community portal   oldwikisource wikisource talk community portal talk page should be used for discussion on that  the respective  yellow  section has been amended and the language information moved to the bottom like the  pedia version  i still think this page could be improved  but it s almost midnight here and it would probably be better if i slept on my ideas    oldwikisource user gregrobson gregrobson   8 july 2005 22 54  utc i think there ought to be at least some very small section on the front page that links to fundimental and frequently used areas  like

september 11  2001 terrorist attack memorials and services prayer service   at   w washington national cathedral washington national cathedral for victims of the september 11  2001 terrorist attacks we are here in the middle hour of our grief  so many have suffered so great a loss  and today we express our nation s sorrow  we come before god to pray for the missing and the dead  and for those who loved them   on tuesday  our country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty  we have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel  now come the names  the list of casualties we are only beginning to read they are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport busy with life  they are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called home to say  be brave  and  i love you  they are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of others on the ground  they are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the united states and died at their posts  they are the names of rescuers  the ones whom death found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others   we will read all these names  we will linger over them and learn their stories  and many americans will weep  to the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost  we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation and i assure you  you are not alone  just three days removed from these events  americans do not yet have the distance of history  but our responsibility to history is already clear  to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil  war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder  this nation is peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger   this conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others  it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing  our purpose as a nation is firm  yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray in many of our prayers this week  there is a searching and an honesty  at st  patrick s cathedral in new york on tuesday  a woman said  i pray to god to give us a sign that he s still here  others have prayed for the same  searching hospital to hospital  carrying pictures of those still missing  god s signs are not always the ones we look for  we learn in tragedy that his purposes are not always our own   yet the prayers and private suffering  whether in our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood  there are prayers that help us last through the day or endure the night  there are prayers of friends and strangers that give us strength for the journey  and there are prayers that yield our will to a will greater than our own this world he created is of moral design  grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time  goodness  remembrance and love have no end  and the lord of life hold all who die and all who mourn   it is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves  this is true of a nation  as well  in this trial  we have been reminded  and the world has seen  that our fellow americans are generous and kind  resourceful and brave  we see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion  in long lines of blood donors  in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible   and we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice  inside the world trade center  one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end at the side of his quadriplegic friend  a beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter  two office workers  finding a disabled stranger  carried her down 68 floors to safety  a group of men drove through the night from dallas to washington to bring skin grafts for burn victims   in these acts and many others  americans showed a deep commitment to one another and an abiding love for our country   today we feel what franklin roosevelt called the  warm courage of national unity  this is the unity of every faith and every background  it has joined together political parties in both houses of congress  it is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils  and american flags which are displayed in pride and wave in defiance  our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies  and this unity against terror is now extending across the world   america is a nation full of good fortune  with so much to be grateful for  but we are not spared from suffering  in every generation  the world has produced enemies of human freedom  they have attacked america because we are freedom s home and defender  and the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time   on this national day of prayer and remembrance  we ask almighty god to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come  we pray that he will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow  we thank him for each life we now must mourn and the promise of a life to come   as we ve been assured  neither death nor life  nor angels  nor principalities  nor powers  nor things present  nor things to come  nor height  nor depth can separate us from god s love  may he bless the souls of the departed  may he comfort our own and may he always guide our country   god bless america pd usgov me9bsphf03tm9wllfqog1a3yuh3nms9 
11 header    title      ryan white s testimony before the president s commission on aids author     ryan white    section previous      next year       1988    notes   thank you  commissioners   my name is ryan white  i am sixteen years old  i have hemophilia  and i have aids when i was three days old  the doctors told my parents i was a severe hemophiliac  meaning my blood does not clot  lucky for me  there was a product just approved by the food and drug administration  it was called factor viii  which contains the clotting agent found in blood   while i was growing up  i had many bleeds or hemorhages in my joints which make it very painful  twice a week i would receive injections or iv s of factor viii which clotted the blood and then broke it down  a bleed occurs from a broken blood vessel or vein  the blood then had nowhere to go so it would swell up in a joint  you could compare it to trying to pour a quart of milk into a pint sized container of milk the first five to six years of my life were spent in and out of the hospital  all in all i led a pretty normal life  most recently my battle has been against aids and the discrimination surrounding it  on december 17  1984  i had surgery to remove two inches of my left lung due to pneumonia  after two hours of surgery the doctors told my mother i had aids  i contracted aids through my factor viii which is made from blood  when i came out of surgery  i was on a respirator and had a tube in my left lung  i spent christmas and the next thirty days in the hospital  a lot of my time was spent searching  thinking and planning my life   i came face to face with death at thirteen years old  i was diagnosed with aids  a killer  doctors told me i m not contagious  given six months to live and being the fighter that i am  i set high goals for myself  it was my decision to live a normal life  go to school  be with my friends  and enjoying day to day activities  it was not going to be easy the school i was going to said they had no guidelines for a person with aids  the school board  my teachers  and my principal voted to keep me out of the classroom even after the guidelines were set by the i s b h   for fear of someone getting aids from me by casual contact  rumors of sneezing  kissing  tears  sweat  and saliva spreading aids caused people to panic   we began a series of court battles for nine months  while i was attending classes by telephone  eventually  i won the right to attend school  but the prejudice was still there  listening to medical facts was not enough  people wanted one hundred percent guarantees  there are no one hundred percent guarantees in life  but concessions were made by mom and me to help ease the fear  we decided to meet them halfway separate restrooms   no gym separate drinking fountains   disposable eating utensils and trays even though we knew aids was not spread through casual contact  nevertheless  parents of twenty students started their own school  they were still not convinced  because of the lack of education on aids  discrimination  fear  panic  and lies surrounded me     i became the target of ryan white jokes lies about me biting people   spitting on vegetables and cookies urinating on bathroom walls   some restaurants threw away my dishes my school locker was vandalized inside and folders were marked fag and other obscenities  i was labeled a troublemaker  my mom an unfit mother  and i was not welcome anywhere  people would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me  even at church  people would not shake my hand this brought on the news media  tv crews  interviews  and numerous public appearances  i became known as the aids boy  i received thousands of letters of support from all around the world  all because i wanted to go to school  mayor koch  of new york  was the first public figure to give me support  entertainers  athletes  and stars started giving me support  i met some of the greatest like elton john  greg louganis  max headroom  alyssa milano  my teen idol   lyndon king  los angeles raiders   and charlie sheen  all of these plus many more became my friends  but i had very few friends at school  how could these people in the public eye not be afraid of me  but my whole town was   it was difficult  at times  to handle  but i tried to ignore the injustice  because i knew the people were wrong  my family and i held no hatred for those people because we realized they were victims of their own ignorance  we had great faith that with patience  understanding  and education  that my family and i could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around  financial hardships were rough on us  even though mom had a good job at g m  the more i was sick  the more work she had to miss  bills became impossible to pay  my sister  andrea  was a championship roller skater who had to sacrifice too  there was no money for her lessons and travel  aids can destroy a family if you let it  but luckily for my sister and me  mom taught us to keep going  don t give up  be proud of who you are  and never feel sorry for yourself after two and a half years of declining health  two attacks of pneumocystis  shingles  a rare form of whooping cough  and liver problems  i faced fighting chills  fevers  coughing  tiredness  and vomiting  i was very ill and being tutored at home  the desire to move into a bigger house  to avoid living aids daily  and a dream to be accepted by a community and school  became possible and a reality with a movie about my life  the ryan white story my life is better now  at the end of the school year  1986 87   my family and i decided to move to cicero  indiana  we did a lot of hoping and praying that the community would welcome us  and they did  for the first time in three years  we feel we have a home  a supportive school  and lots of friends  the communities of cicero  atlanta  arcadia  and noblesville  indiana  are now what we call  home  i m feeling great  i am a normal happy teenager again  i have a learner s permit  i attend sports functions and dances  my studies are important to me  i made the honor roll just recently  with 2 a s and 2 b s  i m just one of the kids  and all because the students at hamilton heights high school listened to the facts  educated their parents and themselves  and believed in me   i believe in myself as i look forward to graduating from hamilton heights high school in 1991 hamilton heights high school is proof that aids education in schools works  ru показания райана уайта перед президентской

22 similar optimism      header title      optimism    author     helen keller section       previous next          year       1903 notes part i   optimism within    could we choose our environment  and were desire in human undertakings synonymous with endowment  all men would  i suppose  be optimists  certainly most of us regard happiness as the proper end of all earthly enterprise  the will to be happy animates alike the philosopher  the prince and the chimney sweep  no matter how dull  or how mean  or how wise a man is  he feels that happiness is his indisputable right it is curious to observe what different ideals of happiness people cherish  and in what singular places they look for this well spring of their life  many look for it in the hoarding of riches  some in the pride of power  and others in the achievements of art and literature  a few seek it in the exploration of their own minds  or in the search for knowledge   most peo ple measure their happiness in terms of physical pleasure and material possession  could they win some visible goal which they have set on the horizon  how happy they would be  lacking this gift or that circumstance  they would be miserable  if happiness is to be so measured  i who cannot hear or see have every reason to sit in a corner with folded hands and weep  if i am happy in spite of my deprivations  if my happiness is so deep that it is a faith  so thoughtful that it becomes a philosophy of life  —if  in short  i am an optimist  my testimony to the creed of optimism is worth hearing  as sinners stand up in meeting and testify to the goodness of god  so one who is called afflicted may rise up in gladness of conviction and testify to the goodness of life   once i knew the depth where no hope was  and darkness lay on the face of all things  then love came and set my soul free  once i knew only darkness and stillness  now i know hope and joy  once i fretted and beat myself against the wall that shut me in  now i rejoice in the consciousness that i can think  act and attain heaven  my life was without past or future  death  the pessimist would say  a consummation devoutly to be wished  but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness  and my heart leaped to the rapture of living  night fled before the day of thought  and love and joy and hope came up in a passion of obedience to knowledge  can anyone who escaped such captivity  who has felt the thrill and glory of freedom  be a pessimist   my early experience was thus a leap from bad to good  if i tried  i could not check the momentum of my first leap out of the dark  to move breast forward as a habit learned suddenly at that first moment of release and rush into the light  with the first word i used intelligently  i learned to live  to think  to hope  darkness cannot shut me in again  i have had a glimpse of the shore  and can now live by the hope of reaching it so my optimism is no mild and unreasoning satisfaction  a poet once said i must be happy because i did not see the bare  cold present  but lived in a beautiful dream  i do live in a beautiful dream  but that dream is the actual  the present  —not cold  but warm  not bare  but furnished with a thousand blessings  the very evil which the poet supposed would be a cruel disillusionment is necessary to the fullest knowledge of joy  only by contact with evil could i have learned to feel by contrast the beauty of truth and love and goodness   it is a mistake always to contemplate the good and ignore the evil  because by making people neglectful it lets in disaster  there is a dangerous optimism of ignorance and indifference  it is not enough to say that the twentieth century is the best age in the history of mankind  and to take refuge from the evils of the world in skyey dreams of good  how many good men  prosperous and contented  looked around and saw naught but good  while millions of their fellow men were bartered and sold like cattle  no doubt  there were comfortable optimists who thought wilberforce a meddlesome fanatic when he was working with might and main to free the slaves  i distrust the rash optimism in this country that cries  hurrah  we re all right  this is the greatest nation on earth  when there are grievances that call loudly for redress  that is false optimism  optimism that does not count the cost is like a house builded on sand  a man must understand evil and be acquainted with sorrow before he can write himself an optimist and expect others to believe that he has reason for the faith that is in him   i know what evil is  once or twice i have wrestled with it  and for a time felt its chilling touch on my life  so i speak with knowledge when i say that evil is of no consequence  except as a sort of mental gymnastic  for the very reason that i have come in contact with it  i am more truly an optimist  i can say with conviction that the struggle which evil necessitates is one of the greatest blessings  it makes us strong  patient  helpful men and women  it lets us into the soul of things and teaches us that although the world is full of suffering  it is full also of the overcoming of it  my optimism  then  does not rest on the absence of evil  but on a glad belief in the preponderance of good and a willing effort always to cooperate with the good  that it may prevail  i try to increase the power god has given me to see the best in everything and every one  and make that best a part of my life  the world is sown with good  but unless i turn my glad thoughts into practical living and till my own field  i cannot reap a kernel of the good thus my optimism is grounded in two worlds  myself and what is about me  i demand that the world be good  and lo  it obeys  i proclaim the world good  and facts range themselves to prove my proclamation overwhelmingly true  to what good i open the doors of my being  and jealously shut them against what is bad  such is the force of this beautiful and willful conviction  it carries itself in the face of all opposition  i am never discouraged by absence of good  i never can be argued into hopelessness  doubt and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination  which the steadfast heart will conquer  and the large mind transcend   as my college days draw to a close  i find myself looking forward with beating heart and bright anticipations to what the future holds of activity for me  my share in the work of the world may be limited  but the fact that it is work makes it precious  nay  the desire and will to work is optimism itself two generations ago carlyle flung forth his gospel of work  to the dreamers of the revolution  who built cloud castles of happiness  and  when the inevitable winds rent the castles asunder  turned pessimists —to those ineffectual endymions  alastors and werthers  this scots peasant  man of dreams in the hard  practical world  cried aloud his creed of labor  be no longer a chaos  but a world  produce  produce  were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of product  produce it  in god s name   tis the utmost thou hast in thee  out with it  then  up  up  whatsoever thy hand findeth to do  do it with thy whole might  work while it is called to day  for the night cometh wherein no man may work  some have said carlyle was taking refuge from a hard world by bidding men grind and toil  eyes to the earth  and so forget their misery  this is not carlyle s thought  fool  he cries  the ideal is in thyself  the impediment is also in thyself  work out the ideal in the poor  miserable actual  live  think  believe  and be free  it is plain what he says  that work  production  brings life out of chaos  makes the individual a world  an order  and order is optimism   i  too  can work  and because i love to labor with my head and my hands  i am an optimist in spite of all  i used to think i should be thwarted in my desire to do something useful  but i have found out that through the ways in which i can make myself useful are few  yet the work open to me is endless  the gladdest laborer in the vineyard may be a cripple  even should the others outstrip him  yet the vineyard ripens in the sun each year  and the full clusters weigh into his hand  darwin could work only half an hour at a time  yet in many diligent half hours he laid anew the foundations of philosophy  i long to accomplish a great and noble task  but it is my chief duty and joy to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble  it is my service to think how i can best fulfill the demands that each day makes upon me  and to rejoice that others can do what i cannot  green  the historian  tells us that the world is moved along  not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes  but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker  and that thought alone suffices to guide me in this dark world and wide  i love the good that others do  for their activity is an assurance that whether i can help or not  the true and the good will stand sure i trust  and nothing that happens disturbs my trust  i recognize the beneficence of the power which we all worship as supreme— order  fate  the great spirit  nature  god  i recognize this power in the sun that makes all things grow and keeps life afoot  i make a friend of this indefinable force  and straightway i feel glad  brave and ready for any lot heaven may decree for me  this is my religion of optimism part ii   optimism without    optimism  then  is a fact within my own heart  but as i look out upon life  my heart meets no contradiction  the outward world justifies my inward universe of good  all through the years i have spent in college  my reading has been a continuous discovery of good  in literature  philosophy  religion and history i find the mighty witnesses to my faith philosophy is the history of a deaf blind person writ large  from the talks of socrates up through plato  berkeley and kant  philosophy records the efforts of human intelligence to be free of the clogging material world and fly forth into a universe of pure idea  a deaf blind person ought to find special meaning in plato s ideal world  these things which you see and hear and touch are not the reality of realities  but imperfect manifestations of the idea  the principal  the spiritual  the idea is the truth  the rest is delusion   if this be so  my brethren who enjoy the fullest use of the senses are not aware of any reality which may not equally well be in reach of my mind  philosophy gives to the mind the prerogative of seeing truth  and bears us not a realm where i  who am blind  and not different from you who see  when i learned from berkeley that your eyes receive an inverted image of things which your brain unconsciously corrects  i began to suspect that the eye is not a very reliable instrument after all  and i felt as one who had been restored to equality with others  glad  not because the senses avail them so little  but because in god s eternal world  mind and spirit avail so much  it seemed to me that philosophy had been written for my special consolation  whereby i get even with some modern philosophers who apparently think that i was intended as an experimental case for their special instruction  but in a little measure my small voice of individual experience does join in the declaration of philosophy that the good is the only world  and that world is a world of spirit  it is also a universe where order is all  where an unbroken logic holds the parts together  where distance defines itself as non existence  where evil  as st  augustine held  is delusion  and therefore is not the meaning of philosophy to me is not only its principles  but also in the happy isolation of its great expounders  they were seldom of the world  even when like plato and leibnitz they moved in its courts and drawing rooms  to the tumult of life they were deaf  and they were blind to its distraction and perplexing diversities  sitting alone  but not in darkness  they learned to find everything in themselves  and failing to find it even there  they still trusted in meeting the truth face to face when they should leave the earth behind and become partakers in the wisdom of god  the great mystics lived alone  deaf and blind  but dwelling with god   i understand how it was possible for spinoza to find deep and sustained happiness when he was excommunicated  poor  despised and suspected alike by jew and christian  not that the kind world of men ever treated me so  but that his isolation from the universe of sensuous joys is somewhat analogous to mine  he loved the good for its own sake  like many great spirits he accepted his place in the world  and confided himself childlike to a higher power  believing that it worked through his hands and predominated in his being  he trusted implicitly  and that is what i do  deep  solemn optimism  it seems to me  should spring from this firm belief in the presence of god in the individual  not a remote  unapproachable governor of the universe  but a god who is very near every one of us  who is present not only in earth  sea and sky  but also in every pure and noble impulse of our hearts  the source and centre of all minds  their only point of rest  thus from the philosophy i learn that we see only shadows and know only in part  and that all things change  but the mind  the unconquerable mind  compasses all truth  embraces the universe as it is  converts the shadows to realities and makes tumultuous changes seem but moments in an eternal silence  or short lines in the infinite theme of perfection  and the evil but  a halt on the way to good  though with my hand i grasp only a small part of the universe  with my spirit i see the whole  and in my thought i can compass the beneficent laws by which it is governed  the confidence and trust which these conceptions inspire teach me to rest safe in my life as in a fate  and protect me from spectral doubts and fears  verily  blessed are ye that have not seen  and yet have believed   all the world s great philosophers have been lovers of god and believers in man s inner goodness  to know the history of philosophy is to know that the highest thinkers of the ages  the seers of the tribes and the nations  have been optimists the growth of philosophy is the story of man s spiritual life  outside lies that great mass of events which we call history  as i look on this mass i see it take form and shape itself in the ways of god  the history of man is an epic of progress  in the world within and the world without i see a wonderful correspondence  a glorious symbolism which reveals the human divine communing together  the lesson of philosophy repeated in fact  in all the parts that compose  the history of mankind hides the spirit of good  and gives meaning to the whole   far back in the twilight of history i see the savage fleeing from the forces of nature which he has not learned control  and seeking to propitiate supernatural beings which are but the creation of his superstitious fear  with a shift of his imagination i see the savage emancipated  civilized  he no longer worships the grim deities of ignorance  through suffering he has learned to build a roof over his head  to defend his life and his home  and over his state he has erected a temple in which he worships the joyous gods of light and song  from suffering he has learned justice  from the struggle with his fellows he has learned the distinction between right and wrong which makes him a moral being  he is sighted with the genius of greece but greece was not perfect  her poetical and religious ideals were far above her practice  therefore she died  that her ideals might survive to ennoble coming ages   rome  too  left the world a rich inheritance  through the vicissitudes of history her laws and ordered government have stood a majestic object lesson for the ages  but when the stern  frugal character of her people ceased to be the bone and sinew of her civilization  rome fell then came the new nations of the north and founded a more permanent society  the base of greek and roman society was the slave  crushed into the condition of the wretches who  labored  foredone in the field and at the workshop  like haltered horses  if blind  so much the quieter  the base of the new society was the freeman who fought  tilled  judged and grew from more to more  he wrought a state out of tribal kinship and fostered an independence and self reliance which no oppression could destroy  the story of man s slow ascent from savagery through barbarism and self mastery to civilization is the embodiment of the spirit of optimism  from the first hour of the new nations each century has seen a better europe  until the development of the world demanded america   tolstoi said the other day that america  once the hope of the world  was in bondage to mammon  tolstoi and other europeans have still much to learn about this great  free country of ours before they understand the unique civic struggle which america is undergoing  she is confronted with the mighty task of assimilating all the foreigners that are drawn together from every country  and welding them into one people with one national spirit  we have the right to demand the forbearance of critics until the united states has demonstrated whether she can make one people out of all nations of the earth  london economists are alarmed at less than five hundred thousand foreign born in a population of six million  and discuss earnestly the danger of too many aliens  but what is their problem in comparison with that of new york  which counts nearly one million five hundred thousand foreigners among its three and a half million citizens  think of it  every third person in our american metropolis is an alien  by these figures alone america s greatness can be measured   it is true  america has devoted herself largely to the solution of material problems—breaking the fields  opening mines  irrigating the deserts  spanning the continent with railroads  but she is doing these things in a new way  by educating her people  by placing at the service of every man s need every resource of human skill  she is transmuting her industrial wealth into the education of her workmen  so that unskilled people shall have no place in american life  so that all men shall bring mind and soul to the control of matter  her children are not drudges and slaves  the constitution has declared it  and the spirit of our institutions has confirmed it  the best the land can teach them they shall know  they shall learn that there is no upper class in their country  and no lower  and they shall understand how it is that god and his world are for everybody america might do all this  and still be selfish  still be a worshipper of mammon  but america is the home of charity as well as commerce  in the midst of roaring traffic  side by side with noisy factory and sky reaching warehouse  one sees the school  the library  the hospital  the park works of public benevolence which represent wealth wrought into ideas that shall endure forever  behold what america has already done to alleviate suffering and restore the afflicted to society —given sight to the fingers of the blind  language to the dumb lip  and mind to the idiot clay  and tell me if indeed she worships mammon only  who shall measure the sympathy  skill and intelligence with which she ministers to all who come to her  and lessens the ever swelling tide of poverty  misery and degradation which every year rolls against her gates from all the nations  when i reflect on all these facts  i cannot but think that  tolstoi and other theorists to the contrary  it is a splendid thing to be an american  in america the optimist finds abundant reason for confidence in the present and hope for the future  and this hope  this confidence  may well extend over all the great nations of the earth   if we compare our own time with the past  we find in modern statistics a solid foundation for a confident and buoyant world optimism  beneath the doubt  the unrest  the materialism  which surround us still glows and burns at the world s best life a steadfast faith  to hear the pessimist  one would think civilization had bivouacked in the middle ages  and had not had marching orders since  he does not realize that the progress of evolution is not an uninterrupted march   i   now touching goal  now backward hurl d    toils the indomitable world   i  i have recently read an address by one whose knowledge it would be presumptuous to challenge  in it i find abundant evidence of progress   during the past fifty years crime has decreased  true  the records of to day contain a longer list of crime  but our statistics are more complete and accurate than the statistics of times past  besides  there are many offenses on the list which half a century ago would not have been thought of as crimes  this shows that the public conscience is more sensitive than it ever was our definition of crime has grown stricter  our punishment of it more lenient and intelligent  the old feeling of revenge has largely disappeared  it is no longer an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth  the criminal is treated as one who is diseased  he is confined not merely for punishment  but because he is a menace to society  while he is under restraint  he is treated with human care and disciplined so that his mind shall be cured of its disease  and he shall be restored to society able to so his part of its work   another sign of awakened and enlightened public conscience is the effort to provide the working class with better houses  did it occur to anyone a hundred years ago to think whether the dwellings of the poor were sanitary  convenient or sunny  do not forget that in the  good old times  cholera and typhus devastated whole counties  and that pestilence walked abroad in the capitals of europe   not only have our laboring classes better houses and better places to work in  but employers recognize the right of the employed to seek more than the bare wage of existence  in the darkness and turmoil of our modern industrial strifes we discern but dimly the principles that underlie the struggle  the recognition of the right of all men to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  a spirit of conciliation such as burke dreamed of  the willingness on the part of the strong to make concessions to the weak  the realization that the rights of the employer are bound up in the rights of the employed —in these the optimist beholds the signs of our times another right which state has recognized as belonging to each man is the right to an education  in the enlightened parts of europe and in america every city  every town  every village  has its school  and it is no longer a class who have access to knowledge  for to the children of the poorest laborer the school door stands open  from the civilized nations universal education is driving the dull host of illiteracy   education broadens to include all men  and deepens to teach all truths  scholars are no longer confined to greek  latin and mathematics  but they also study science converts the dreams of the poet  the theory of the mathematician and the fiction of the economist into ships  hospitals and instruments that enable one skilled hand to perform the work of a thousand  the student of to day is not asked if he has learned his grammar  is he a mere grammar machine  a dry catalogue of scientific facts  or has he acquired the qualities of manliness  his supreme lesson is to grapple with great public questions  to keep his mind hospitable to new idea and new views of truth  to restore the finer ideals that are lost sight of in the struggle for wealth and to promote justice between man and man  he learns that there may be substitutes for human labor —horse power and machinery and books  but  there are no substitutes for common sense  patience  integrity  courage  who can doubt the vastness of the achievements of education when one considers how different the conditions of the blind and the deaf is from what it was a century ago  they were then objects of superstitious pity  and shared the lowest beggar s lot  everybody looked upon their case as hopeless  and this view plunged them deeper in despair  the blind themselves laughed in the face of hauy when he offered to teach them to read  how pitiable is the cramped sense of imprisonment in circumstances which teaches men to expect no good and to treat any attempt to relieve them as the vagary of a disordered mind  but now  behold the transformation  see how institutions and industrial establishments for the blind have sprung up as if by magic  see how many of the deaf have learned not only to read and write  but to speak  and remember that the faith and patience of dr  howe have borne fruit in the efforts that are being made everywhere to educate the deaf blind and equip them for the struggle  do you wonder that i am full of hope and lifted up   the highest result of education is tolerance  long ago men fought and died for their faith  but it took ages to teach them the other kind of courage  —the courage to recognize the faiths of their brethren and their rights of conscience  tolerance is the first principal of community  it is the spirit which conser ves the best that all men think  no loss by flood and lightening  no destruction of cities and temples by the hostile forces of nature  has deprived man of so many noble lives and impulses as those which his tolerance has destroyed   with wonder and sorrow i go back in thought to the ages of intolerance and bigotry  i see jesus received with scorn and nailed on the cross  i see his followers hounded and tortured and burned  i am present where the finer spirits that revolt from the superstition of the middle ages are accused of impiety and stricken down  i behold the children of israel reviled and persecuted unto death by those who pretend christianity with the tongue  i see them driven from land to land  hunted from refuge to refuge  summoned to the felon s place  exposed to the whip  mocked as they utter amid the pain of martyrdom a confession of the faith which they have kept with such splendid constancy  the same bigotry that oppress the jews falls tiger like upon christian nonconformists of purest lives and wipes out the albigenses and the peaceful vaudois  whose bones lie on the mountains cold  i see the clouds part slowly  and i hear a cry of protest against the bigot  the restraining hand of tolerance is laid upon the inquisitor  and the humanist utters a message of peace to the persecuted  instead of the cry  burn the heretic  men study the human soul with sympathy  and there enters into their hearts a new reverence for that which is unseen   the idea of brotherhood redawns upon the world with a broader significance than the narrow association of members in a sect or creed  and thinkers of great soul like lessing challenge the world to say which is more godlike  the hatred and tooth and nail grapple of conflicting religions  or sweet accord and mutual helpfulness  ancient prejudice of man against his brother man wavers and retreats before the radiance of a more generous sentiment  which will not sacrifice men to forms  or rob them of the comfort and strength they find in their own beliefs  the heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next  mere tolerance has given place to a sentiment of brotherhood between sincere men of all denominations  the optimist rejoices in the affectionate sympathy between catholic heart and protestant heart which finds a gratifying expression in the universal respect and warm admiration for leo xiii on the part of good men the world over  the centenary celebrations of the births of emerson and channing are beautiful examples of the tribute which men of all creeds pay to the memory of a pure soul thus in my outlook upon our times i find that i am glad to be a citizen of the world  as i regard my country  i find that to be an american is to be an optimist  i know the unhappy and unrighteous story of what has been done in the philippines beneath our flag  but i believe that in the accidents of statecraft the best intelligence of the people sometimes fails to express itself  i read in history of julius caesar that during the civil wars there were millions of peaceful herdsmen and laborers who worked as long as they could  and fled before the advance of the armies that were led by the few  then waited until the danger was past  and returned to repair damages with patient hands  so the people are patient and honest  while their rulers stumble  i rejoice to see in the world and in this country a new and better patriotism than that which seeks the life of an enemy  it is a patriotism higher than that of the battle field  it moves thousands to lay down their lives in social service  and every life so laid down brings us a step nearer the time when corn fields shall no more be fields of battle  so when i heard of the cruel fighting in the philippines  i did not despair  because i knew that the hearts of our people were not in that fight  and that sometime the hand of the destroyer must be stayed      part iii   the practice of optimism the test of all beliefs is their practical effect in life  it be true that optimism compels the world forward  and pessimism retards it  them it is dangerous to propagate a pessimistic philosophy  one who believes that the pain in the world outweighs the joy  and expresses that unhappy conviction  only adds to the pain  schopenhauer is an enemy to the race  even if he earnestly believed that this is the most wretched of possible worlds  he should not promulgate a doctrine which robs men of the incentive to fight with circumstance  if life gave him ashes for bread  it was his fault  life is a fair field  and the right will prosper if we stand by our guns   let pessimism once take hold of the mind  and life is all topsy turvy  all vanity and vexation of spirit  there is no cure for individual or social disorder  except in forgetfulness and annihilation  let us eat  drink and be merry  says the pessimist  for to morrow we die  if i regarded my life from the point of view of the pessimist  i should be undone  i should seek in vain for the light that does not visit my eyes and the music that does not ring in my ears  i should beg night and day and never be satisfied  i should sit apart in awful solitude  a prey to fear and despair  but since i consider it a duty to myself and to others to be happy  i escape a misery worse than any physical deprivation   who shall dare let his incapacity for hope or goodness cast a shadow upon the courage of those who bear their burdens as if they were privileges  the optimist cannot fall back  cannot falter  for he knows his neighbor will be hindered by his failure to keep in line  he will therefore hold his place fearlessly and remember the duty of silence  sufficient unto each heart is its own sorrow  he will take the iron claws of circumstance in his hand and use them as tools to break away the obstacle that block his path  he will work as if upon him alone depended the establishment of heaven and earth we have seen that the world s philosophers —the sayers of the word— were optimists  so also are the men of action and achievement —the doers of the word  dr  howe found his way to laura bridgman s soul because he began with the belief that he could reach it  english jurists had said that the deaf blind were idiots in the eyes of the law  behold what the optimist does  he converts a hard legal axiom  he looks behind the dull impassive clay and sees a human soul in bondage  and quietly  resolutely sets about its deliverance  his efforts are victorious  he creates intelligence out of idiocy and proves to the law that the deaf blind man is a responsible being   when hauy offered to teach the blind to read  he was met by a pessimism that laughed at his folly  had he not believed that the soul of man is mightier than the ignorance that fetters it  had he not been an optimist  he would not have turned the fingers of the blind into new instruments  no pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars  or sailed to an uncharted land  or opened a new heaven to the human spirit  st  bernard was so deeply an optimist that he believed two hundred and fifty enlightened men could illuminate the darkness which overwhelmed the period of the crusades  and the light of his faith broke like a new day upon western europe    john bosco the benefactor of the poor and the friendless of italian cities  was another optimist  another prophet who  perceiving a divine idea while it was yet afar  proclaimed it to his countrymen  although they laughed at his vision and called him a madman  yet he worked on patiently  and with the labor of his hands he maintained a home for little street waifs  in the fervor of enthusiasm he predicted the wonderful movement which should result from his work  even in the days before he had money or patronage  he drew glowing pictures of the splendid system of schools and hospitals which should spread from one end of italy to the other  and he lived to see the organization of the san salvador society  which was the embodiment of his prophetic optimism  when dr  seguin declared his opinion that the feeble minded could be taught  again people laughed  and in their complacent wisdom said he was no better than an idiot himself  but the noble optimist persevered  and by and by the reluctant pessimists saw that he whom they ridiculed had become one of the world s philanthropists  thus the optimist believes  attempts  achieves  he stands always in the sunlight  some day the wonderful  the inexpressible  arrives and shines upon him  and he is there to welcome it  his soul meets his own and beats a glad march to every new discovery  every fresh victory over difficulties  every addition to human knowledge and happiness we have found that our great philosophers and our great men of action are optimists  so  too  our most potent men of letters have been optimists in their books and in their lives  no pessimist ever won an audience commensurately wide with his genius  and many optimistic writers have been read and admired out of all measure to their talents  simply because they wrote of the sunlit side of life  dickens  lamb  goldsmith  irving  all the well beloved and gentle humorists  were optimists  swift  the pessimist  has never had as many readers as his towering genius should command  and indeed  when he comes down into our century and meets thackeray  that generous optimist can hardly do him justice  in spite of the latter day notoriety of the  rubaiyat  of omar khayyam  we may set it down as a rule that he who would be heard must be a believer  must have a fundamental optimism in his philosophy  he may bluster and disagree and lament as carlyle and ruskin do sometimes  but a basic confidence in the good destiny of life and of the world must underlie his work   shakespeare is the prince of optimists  his tragedies are a revelation of moral order  in  lear  and  hamlet  there is a looking forward to something better  some one is left at the end of the play to right wrong  restore society and build the state anew  the later plays  the tempest  and  cymbeline  show a beautiful  placid optimism which delights in reconciliations and reunions and which plans for the triumph of external as well as internal good   if browning were less difficult to read  he would surely be the dominant poet in this century  i feel the ecstasy with which he exclaims  oh  good gigantic smile o  the brown old earth this autumn morning  and how he sets my brain going when he says  because there is imperfection  there must be perfection  completeness must have come out of uncompleteness   failure is an evidence of triumph for the fullness of the days  yes  discord is  that harmony may be  pain destroys  that health may renew  perhaps i am deaf and blind that others likewise afflicted may see and hear with a more perfect sense  from browning i learn that there is no lost good  and that makes it easier for me to go at life  right or wrong  do the best i know  and fear not  my heart responds proudly to his exhortation to pay gladly life s debt of pain  darkness and cold  lift up your burden  it is god s gift  bear it nobly   the man of letters whose voice is to prevail must be an optimist  and his voice often learns its message from his life  stevenson s life has become a tradition only ten years after his death  he has taken his place among the heros  the bravest man of letters since johnson and lamb  i remember an hour when i was discouraged and ready to falter  for days i had been pegging away at a task which refused to get itself accomplished  in the midst of my perplexity i read an essay of stevenson which made me feel as if i had been  outing  in the sunshine  instead of losing heart over a difficult task  i tried again with new courage and succeeded almost before i knew it  i have failed many times since  but i have never felt so disheartened as i did before that sturdy preacher gave me my lesson in the  fashion of the smiling face  read schopenhauer and omar  and you will grow to find the world as hollow as they find it  read green s history of england  and the world is peopled with heroes  i never knew why green s history thrilled me with the vigor of romance until i read his biography  then i learned how his quick imagination transfigured the hard  bare facts of life into new and living dreams  when he and his wife were too poor to have a fire  he would sit before the unlit hearth and pretend that it was ablaze  drill your thoughts  he said  shut out the gloomy and call in the bright  there is more wisdom in shutting one s eyes than your copybook philosophers will allow  every optimist moves along with progress and hastens it  while every pessimist would keep the worlds at a standstill  the consequence of pessimism in the life of a nation is the same as in the life of the individual  pessimism kills the instinct that urges men to struggle against poverty  ignorance and crime  and dries up all the fountains of joy in the world  in imagination i leave the country which lifts up the manhood of the poor and i visit india  the underworld of fatalism —where three hundred million human beings  scarcely men  submerged in ignorance and misery  precipitate themselves still deeper into the pit  why are they thus  because they have for thousands of years been the victims of their philosophy  which teaches them that men are as grass  and the grass fadeth  and there is no more greenness on the earth  they sit in the shadow and let the circumstances they should master grip them  until they cease to be men  and are made to dance and salaam like puppets in a play  after a little hour death comes and hurries them off to the grave  and other puppets with other  pasteboard passions and desires  take their place  and the show goes on for centuries   go to india and see what sort of civilization is developed when a nation lacks faith in progress and bows to the gods of darkness  under the influence of brahminism genius and ambition have been suppressed  there is no one to befriend the poor or to protect the fatherless and the widow  the sick lie untended  the blind know not how to see  nor the deaf to hear  and they are left by the roadside to die  in india it is a sin to teach the blind and the deaf because their affliction is regarded as a punishment for offenses in a previous state of existence  if i had been born in the midst of these fatalistic doctrines  i should still be in darkness  my life a desert land where no caravan of thought might pass between my spirit and the world beyond the hindoos believe in endurance  but not in resistance  therefore they have been subdued by strangers  their history is a repetition of that babylon  a nation from afar came with speed swiftly  and none stumbled  or slept  or slumbered  but they brought desolation upon the land  and took the stay and the staff from the people  the whole stay of bread  and the whole stay of water  the mighty man  and the man of war  the judge  and the prophet  and the prudent  and the ancient  and none delivered them  woe  indeed  is the heritage of those who walk sad thoughted and downcast through this radiant  soul delighting earth  blind to its beauty and deaf to its music  and of those who call evil good  and good evil  and put darkness for light  and light for darkness   what care the weather bronzed sons of the west  feeding the world from the plains of dakota  for the oars and the brahmins  they would say to the hindoos  blot out your philosophy  dead for a thousand years  look with fresh eyes at reality and life  put away your brahmins and your crooked gods  and seek diligently for vishnu the preserver  optimism is the faith that leads to achievement  nothing can be done without hope  when our forefathers laid the foundation of the american commonwealths  what nerved them to their task but a vision of a free community  against the cold  inhospitable sky  across the wilderness white with snow  where lurked the hidden savage  gleamed the bow of promise  toward which they set their faces with the faith that levels mountains  fills up valleys  bridges rivers and carries civilization to the uttermost parts of the earth  although the pioneers could not build according to the hebraic ideal they saw  yet they gave the pattern of all that is most enduring in our country today  they brought to the wilderness the thinking mind  the printed book  the deep rooted desire for self government and the english common law that judges alike the king and the subject  the law on which rests the whole structure of our society it is significant that the foundation of the law is optimistic  in latin countries the court proceeds with a pessimistic bias  the prisoner is held guilty until he is proved innocent  in england and the united states there is an optimistic presumption that the accused is innocent until it is no longer possible to deny his guilt  under our system  it is said  many criminals are acquitted  but it is surely better so than that many innocent persons should suffer  the pessimist cries  there is no enduring good in man  the tendency of all things is through perpetual loss to chaos in the end  if there was ever an idea of good in things evil  it was impotent  and the world rushes on to ruin  but behold  the law of the two most sober minded  practical and law abiding nations on earth assumes the good in man and demands proof of the bad   optimism is the faith that leads to achievement  the prophets of the world have been good of heart  or their standards would have stood naked in the field without a defender  tolstoi s strictures lose power because they are pessimistic  if he had seen clearly the faults of america  and still believed in her capacity to overcome them  our people might have felt the stimulation of his censure  but the world turns its back on a hopeless prophet and listens to emerson who takes in account the best qualities of the nation and attacks only the vices which no one can defend or deny  it listens to the strong man  lincoln  who in times of doubt  trouble and need does not falter  he sees success afar  and by strenuous hope  by hoping against hope  inspires a nation  through the night of despair he says  all is well  and thousands rest in his confidence  when such a man censures  and points to a fault  the nation obeys  and his words sink into the ears of men  but to the lamentations of the habitual jeremiah the ear grows dull   our newspapers should remember this  the press is the pulpit of the modern world  and on the preachers who fill it much depends  if the protest of the press against unrighteous measures is to avail  then for ninety nine days the word of the preacher should be buoyant and of good cheer  so that on the hundredth day the voice of censure may be a hundred times strong  this was lincoln s way  he knew the people  he believed in them and rested his faith on the justice and wisdom of the great majority  when in his rough and ready way he said  you can t fool all the people all the time  he expressed a great principle  the doctrine of faith in human nature   the prophet is not without honor  save he be a pessimist  the ecstatic prophecies of isaiah did far more to restore the exiles of israel to their homes than the lamentations of jeremiah did to deliver them from the hands of evil doers even on christmas day do men remember that christ came as a prophet of good  his joyous optimism is like water to feverish lips  and has for its highest expression the eight beatitudes  it is because christ is an optimist that for ages he has dominated the western world  for nineteen centuries christendom had gazed into his shining face and felt that all things work together for good  st  paul  too  taught the faith which looks beyond the hardest things into the infinite horizon of heaven  where all limitations are lost in the light of perfect understanding  if you are born blind  search the treasures of darkness  they are more precious than the gold of ophir  they are love and goodness and truth and hope  and their price is above rubies and sapphires   jesus utters and paul proclaims a message of peace and a message of reason  a belief in the idea  not in things  in love  not in conquest  the optimist is he who sees that men s actions are directed not by squadrons and armies  but by moral power  that the conquests of alexander and napoleon are less abiding than newton s and galileo s and st  augustine s silent mastery of the world  ideas are mightier than fire and sword  noiselessly they propagate themselves from land to land  and mankind goes out and reaps the rich harvest and thanks god  but the achievements of the warrior are like his canvas city  to day a camp  to morrow all struck and vanished  a few pit holes and heaps of straw  this was the gospel of jesus two thousand years ago  christmas day is the festival of optimism   although there are still great evils which have not been subdued  and the optimist is not blind to them  yet he is full of hope  despondency has no place in his creed  for he believes in the imperishable righteousness of god and the dignity of man  history records man s triumphant ascent  each halt in his progress has been but a pause before a mighty leap forward  the time is not out of joint  if indeed some if the temples we worship in have fallen  we have built new ones on the sacred sites loftier and holier than those which have crumbled  if we have lost some of the heroic physical qualities of our ancestors  we have replaced them with a spiritual nobleness that turns aside wrath and binds up the wounds of the vanquished  all the past attainments of man are ours  and more  his day dreams have become our clear realities  therein lies our hope and sure faith as i stand in the sunshine if a sincere and earnest optimism  my imagination  paints yet more glorious triumphs on the cloud curtain of the future  out of the fierce struggle and turmoil of contending systems and powers i see a brighter spiritual era slowly emerge —an era in which there shall be no england  no france  no germany  no america  no this people or that  but one family  the human race  one law  peace  one need  harmony  one means  labor  one taskmaster  god   if i should try to say anew the creed of the optimist  i should day something like this  i believe in god  i believe in man  i believe in the power of the spirit  i believe it is a sacred duty to encourage ourselves and others  to hold the tongue from any unhappy word against god s world  because no man has any right to complain of a universe which god made good  and which thousands of men have striven to keep good  i believe we should so act that we may draw nearer and more near the age when no man shall live at his ease while another suffers  these are the articles of my faith  and there is yet another on which all depends —to bear this faith above every tempest which overfloods it  and to make it a principal in disaster and through affliction  optimism is the harmony between man s spirit and of god

hands and feet   essay ii    self reliance i read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional  the soul always hears an admonition in such lines  let the subject be what it may  the sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may contain       to believe your own thought  to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men  —that is genius       speak your latent conviction  and it shall be the universal sense  for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost —  and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the last judgment  familiar as the voice of the mind is to each  the highest merit we ascribe to moses  plato  and milton is  that they set at naught books and traditions  and spoke not what men but what they thought  a man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within  more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages  yet he dismisses without notice his thought  because it is his  in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts  they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty  great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this  they teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good humored inflexibility than most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side  else  to morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time  and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another        there is a time in every man s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance       that imitation is suicide  that he must take himself for better  for worse  as his portion  that though the wide universe is full of good  no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till  the power which resides in him is new in nature  and none but he knows what that is which he can do  nor does he know until he has tried  not for nothing one face  one character  one fact  makes much impression on him  and another none  this sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony  the eye was placed where one ray should fall  that it might testify of that particular ray  we but half express ourselves  and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents  it may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues  so it be faithfully imparted  but god will not have his work made manifest by cowards  a man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best  but what he has said or done otherwise  shall give him no peace  it is a deliverance which does not deliver  in the attempt his genius deserts him  no muse befriends  no invention  no hope trust thyself  every heart vibrates to that iron string       accept the place the divine providence has found for you  the society of your contemporaries  the connection of events  great men have always done so  and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age  betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart  working through their hands  predominating in all their being  and we are now men  and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny  and not minors and invalids in a protected corner  not cowards fleeing before a revolution  but guides  redeemers  and benefactors  obeying the almighty effort  and advancing on chaos and the dark   what pretty oracles nature yields us on this text  in the face and behaviour of children  babes  and even brutes  that divided and rebel mind  that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose  these have not  their mind being whole  their eye is as yet unconquered  and when we look in their faces  we are disconcerted  infancy conforms to nobody  all conform to it  so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it  so god has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm  and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by  if it will stand by itself  do not think the youth has no force  because he cannot speak to you and me  hark  in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic  it seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries  bashful or bold  then  he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary the nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner  and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one  is the healthy attitude of human nature  a boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse  independent  irresponsible  looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by  he tries and sentences them on their merits  in the swift  summary way of boys  as good  bad  interesting  silly  eloquent  troublesome  he cumbers himself never about consequences  about interests  he gives an independent  genuine verdict  you must court him  he does not court you  but the man is  as it were  clapped into jail by his consciousness  as soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat  he is a committed person  watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds  whose affections must now enter into his account  there is no lethe for this  ah  that he could pass again into his neutrality  who can thus avoid all pledges  and having observed  observe again from the same unaffected  unbiased  unbribable  unaffrighted innocence  must always be formidable  he would utter opinions on all passing affairs  which being seen to be not private  but necessary  would sink like darts into the ear of men  and put them in fear these are the voices which we hear in solitude  but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world  society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members  society is a joint stock company  in which the members agree  for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder  to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater  the virtue in most request is conformity  self reliance is its aversion  it loves not realities and creators  but names and customs   whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist  he who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness  but must explore if it be goodness  nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind  absolve you to yourself  and you shall have the suffrage of the world  i remember an answer which when quite young i was prompted to make to a valued adviser  who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church  on my saying  what have i to do with the sacredness of traditions  if i live wholly from within  my friend suggested —  but these impulses may be from below  not from above  i replied  they do not seem to me to be such  but if i am the devil s child  i will live then from the devil  no law can be sacred to me but that of my nature  good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this  the only right is what is after my constitution  the only wrong what is against it  a man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition  as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he  i am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names  to large societies and dead institutions  every decent and well spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right  i ought to go upright and vital  and speak the rude truth in all ways  if malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy  shall that pass  if an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of abolition  and comes to me with his last news from barbadoes  why should i not say to him   go love thy infant  love thy wood chopper  be good natured and modest  have that grace  and never varnish your hard  uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off  thy love afar is spite at home   rough and graceless would be such greeting  but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love  your goodness must have some edge to it  —else it is none  the doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines  i shun father and mother and wife and brother  when my genius calls me  i would write on the lintels of the door post  whim  i hope it is somewhat better than whim at last  but we cannot spend the day in explanation  expect me not to show cause why i seek or why i exclude company  then  again  do not tell me  as a good man did to day  of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations  are they my poor  i tell thee  thou foolish philanthropist  that i grudge the dollar  the dime  the cent  i give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom i do not belong  there is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity i am bought and sold  for them i will go to prison  if need be  but your miscellaneous popular charities  the education at college of fools  the building of meeting houses to the vain end to which many now stand  alms to sots  and the thousandfold relief societies  —though i confess with shame i sometimes succumb and give the dollar  it is a wicked dollar which by and by i shall have the manhood to withhold   virtues are  in the popular estimate  rather the exception than the rule  there is the man and his virtues  men do what is called a good action  as some piece of courage or charity  much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non appearance on parade  their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world —as invalids and the insane pay a high board  their virtues are penances  i do not wish to expiate  but to live  my life is for itself and not for a spectacle  i much prefer that it should be of a lower strain  so it be genuine and equal  than that it should be glittering and unsteady  i wish it to be sound and sweet  and not to need diet and bleeding  i ask primary evidence that you are a man  and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions  i know that for myself it makes no difference whether i do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent  i cannot consent to pay for a privilege where i have intrinsic right  few and mean as my gifts may be  i actually am  and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony what i must do is all that concerns me  not what the people think  this rule  equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life  may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness  it is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it  it is easy in the world to live after the world s opinion  it is easy in solitude to live after our own  but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude   the objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force  it loses your time and blurs the impression of your character  if you maintain a dead church  contribute to a dead bible society  vote with a great party either for the government or against it  spread your table like base housekeepers —under all these screens i have difficulty to detect the precise man you are  and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life  but do your work  and i shall know you  do your work  and you shall reinforce yourself  a man must consider what a blind man s buff is this game of conformity  if i know your sect i anticipate your argument  i hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church  do i not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new spontaneous word  do i not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing  do i not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side  the permitted side  not as a man  but as a parish minister  he is a retained attorney  and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation  well  most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief  and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion  this conformity makes them not false in a few particulars  authors of a few lies  but false in all particulars  their every truth is not quite true  their two is not the real two  their four not the real four  so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right  meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison uniform of the party to which we adhere  we come to wear one cut of face and figure  and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression  there is a mortifying experience in particular  which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history  i mean  the foolish face of praise  the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease  in answer to conversation which does not interest us  the muscles  not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness  grow tight about the outline of the face  with the most disagreeable sensation for nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure  and therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face  the by standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend s parlor  if this aversion had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance  but the sour faces of the multitude  like their sweet faces  have no deep cause  but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs  yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college  it is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes  their rage is decorous and prudent  for they are timid  as being very vulnerable themselves  but when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added  when the ignorant and the poor are aroused  when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow  it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment   the other terror that scares us from self trust is our consistency  a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts  and we are loath to disappoint them but why should you keep your head over your shoulder  why drag about this corpse of your memory  lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place  suppose you should contradict yourself  what then  it seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone  scarcely even in acts of pure memory  but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand eyed present  and live ever in a new day  in your metaphysics you have denied personality to the deity  yet when the devout motions of the soul come  yield to them heart and life though they should clothe god with shape and color  leave your theory  as joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot  and flee   a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds  adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines  with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do  he may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall  speak what you think now in hard words  and to morrow speak what to morrow thinks in hard words again  though it contradict every thing you said to day —  ah  so you shall be sure to be misunderstood   —is it so bad  then  to be misunderstood  pythagoras was misunderstood  and socrates  and jesus  and luther  and copernicus  and galileo  and newton  and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh  to be great is to be misunderstood i suppose no man can violate his nature  all the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being  as the inequalities of andes and himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere  nor does it matter how you gauge and try him  a character is like an acrostic or alexandrian stanza  —read it forward  backward  or across  it still spells the same thing  in this pleasing  contrite wood life which god allows me  let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect  and  i cannot doubt  it will be found symmetrical  though i mean it not  and see it not  my book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects  the swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also  we pass for what we are  character teaches above our wills  men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions  and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment   there will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions  so they be each honest and natural in their hour  for of one will  the actions will be harmonious  however unlike they seem  these varieties are lost sight of at a little distance  at a little height of thought  one tendency unites them all  the voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks  see the line from a sufficient distance  and it straightens itself to the average tendency  your genuine action will explain itself  and will explain your other genuine actions  your conformity explains nothing  act singly  and what you have already done singly will justify you now  greatness appeals to the future  if i can be firm enough to day to do right  and scorn eyes  i must have done so much right before as to defend me now  be it how it will  do right now  always scorn appearances  and you always may  the force of character is cumulative  all the foregone days of virtue work their health into this  what makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field  which so fills the imagination  the consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind  they shed an united light on the advancing actor  he is attended as by a visible escort of angels  that is it which throws thunder into   w william fitzhugh chatham s voice  and dignity into   w george washington washington   s port  and america into   w john adams adams s eye  honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris  it is always ancient virtue  we worship it to day because it is not of to day  we love it and pay it homage  because it is not a trap for our love and homage  but is self dependent  self derived  and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree  even if shown in a young person   i hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency  let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward  instead of the gong for dinner  let us hear a whistle from the spartan fife  let us never bow and apologize more  a great man is coming to eat at my house  i do not wish to please him  i wish that he should wish to please me  i will stand here for humanity  and though i would make it kind  i would make it true  let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times  and hurl in the face of custom  and trade  and office  the fact which is the upshot of all history  that there is a great responsible thinker and actor working wherever a man works  that a true man belongs to no other time or place  but is the centre of things  where he is  there is nature  he measures you  and all men  and all events  ordinarily  every body in society reminds us of somewhat else  or of some other person  character  reality  reminds you of nothing else  it takes place of the whole creation  the man must be so much  that he must make all circumstances indifferent  every true man is a cause  a country  and an age  requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design  —and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients  a man caesar is born  and for ages after we have a roman empire  christ is born  and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius  that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man  an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man  as    w christian monasticism monachism of the   w anthony the great hermit antony    the   w protestant reformation reformation of   w martin luther luther      w religious society of friends quakerism of   w george fox fox      w methodism methodism of   w john wesley wesley      w abolitionism abolition of   w thomas clarkson clarkson      w scipio africanus scipio milton called  the height of rome  and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons   let a man then know his worth  and keep things under his feet  let him not peep or steal  or skulk up and down with the air of a charity boy  a bastard  or an interloper  in the world which exists for him  but the man in the street  finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god  feels poor when he looks on these  to him a palace  a statue  or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air  much like a gay equipage  and seem to say like that who are you  sir   yet they all are his  suitors for his notice  petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession  the picture waits for my verdict  it is not to command me  but i am to settle its claims to praise  that popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street  carried to the duke s house  washed and dressed and laid in the duke s bed  and  on his waking  treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke  and assured that he had been insane  owes its popularity to the fact  that it symbolizes so well the state of man  who is in the world a sort of sot  but now and then wakes up  exercises his reason  and finds himself a true prince   our reading is mendicant and sycophantic  in history  our imagination plays us false  kingdom and lordship  power and estate  are a gaudier vocabulary than private john and edward in a small house and common day s work  but the things of life are the same to both  the sum total of both is the same  why all this deference to alfred  and scanderbeg  and gustavus  suppose they were virtuous  did they wear out virtue  as great a stake depends on your private act to day  as followed their public and renowned steps  when private men shall act with original views  the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen the world has been instructed by its kings  who have so magnetized the eyes of nations  it has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man  the joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king  the noble  or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own  make his own scale of men and things  and reverse theirs  pay for benefits not with money but with honor  and represent the law in his person  was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness  the right of every man   the magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self trust  who is the trustee  what is the aboriginal self  on which a universal reliance may be grounded  what is the nature and power of that science baffling star  without parallax  without calculable elements  which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions  if the least mark of independence appear  the inquiry leads us to that source  at once the essence of genius  of virtue  and of life  which we call spontaneity or instinct  we denote this primary wisdom as intuition  whilst all later teachings are tuitions  in that deep force  the last fact behind which analysis cannot go  all things find their common origin  for  the sense of being which in calm hours rises  we know not how  in the soul  is not diverse from things  from space  from light  from time  from man  but one with them  and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed  we first share the life by which things exist  and afterwards see them as appearances in nature  and forget that we have shared their cause  here is the fountain of action and of thought  here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom  and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism  we lie in the lap of immense intelligence  which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity  when we discern justice  when we discern truth  we do nothing of ourselves  but allow a passage to its beams  if we ask whence this comes  if we seek to pry into the soul that causes  all philosophy is at fault  its presence or its absence is all we can affirm  every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind  and his involuntary perceptions  and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due  he may err in the expression of them  but he knows that these things are so  like day and night  not to be disputed  my wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving  —the idlest reverie  the faintest native emotion  command my curiosity and respect  thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions  or rather much more readily  for  they do not distinguish between perception and notion  they fancy that i choose to see this or that thing  but perception is not whimsical  but fatal  if i see a trait  my children will see it after me  and in course of time  all mankind  —although it may chance that no one has seen it before me  for my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun the relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure  that it is profane to seek to interpose helps  it must be that when god speaketh he should communicate  not one thing  but all things  should fill the world with his voice  should scatter forth light  nature  time  souls  from the centre of the present thought  and new date and new create the whole  whenever a mind is simple  and receives a divine wisdom  old things pass away  —means  teachers  texts  temples fall  it lives now  and absorbs past and future into the present hour  all things are made sacred by relation to it  —one as much as another  all things are dissolved to their centre by their cause  and  in the universal miracle  petty and particular miracles disappear  if  therefore  a man claims to know and speak of god  and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country  in another world  believe him not  is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion  is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being  whence  then  this worship of the past  the centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul  time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes  but the soul is light  where it is  is day  where it was  is night  and history is an impertinence and an injury  if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming   man is timid and apologetic  he is no longer upright  he dares not say  i think    i am   but quotes some saint or sage  he is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose  these roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones  they are for what they are  they exist with god to day  there is no time to them  there is simply the rose  it is perfect in every moment of its existence  before a leaf bud has burst  its whole life acts  in the full blown flower there is no more  in the leafless root there is no less  its nature is satisfied  and it satisfies nature  in all moments alike  but man postpones or remembers  he does not live in the present  but with reverted eye laments the past  or  heedless of the riches that surround him  stands on tiptoe to foresee the future  he cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present  above time this should be plain enough  yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear god himself  unless he speak the phraseology of i know not what david  or jeremiah  or paul  we shall not always set so great a price on a few texts  on a few lives  we are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors  and  as they grow older  of the men of talents and character they chance to see  —painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke  afterwards  when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings  they understand them  and are willing to let the words go  for  at any time  they can use words as good when occasion comes  if we live truly  we shall see truly  it is as easy for the strong man to be strong  as it is for the weak to be weak  when we have new perception  we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish  when a man lives with god  his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn   and now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid  probably cannot be said  for all that we say is the far off remembering of the intuition  that thought  by what i can now nearest approach to say it  is this  when good is near you  when you have life in yourself  it is not by any known or accustomed way  you shall not discern the foot prints of any other  you shall not see the face of man  you shall not hear any name ——the way  the thought  the good  shall be wholly strange and new  it shall exclude example and experience  you take the way from man  not to man  all persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers  fear and hope are alike beneath it  there is somewhat low even in hope  in the hour of vision  there is nothing that can be called gratitude  nor properly joy  the soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation  perceives the self existence of truth and right  and calms itself with knowing that all things go well  vast spaces of nature  the atlantic ocean  the south sea  —long intervals of time  years  centuries  —are of no account  this which i think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances  as it does underlie my present  and what is called life  and what is called death   life only avails  not the having lived  power ceases in the instant of repose  it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state  in the shooting of the gulf  in the darting to an aim  this one fact the world hates  that the soul becomes  for that for ever degrades the past  turns all riches to poverty  all reputation to a shame  confounds the saint with the rogue  shoves jesus and judas equally aside  why  then  do we prate of self reliance  inasmuch as the soul is present  there will be power not confident but agent  to talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking  speak rather of that which relies  because it works and is  who has more obedience than i masters me  though he should not raise his finger  round him i must revolve by the gravitation of spirits  we fancy it rhetoric  when we speak of eminent virtue  we do not yet see that virtue is height  and that a man or a company of men  plastic and permeable to principles  by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities  nations  kings  rich men  poets  who are not this is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this  as on every topic  the resolution of all into the ever blessed one  self existence is the attribute of the supreme cause  and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms  all things real are so by so much virtue as they contain  commerce  husbandry  hunting  whaling  war  eloquence  personal weight  are somewhat  and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action  i see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth  power is in nature the essential measure of right  nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself  the genesis and maturation of a planet  its poise and orbit  the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind  the vital resources of every animal and vegetable  are demonstrations of the self sufficing  and therefore self relying soul   thus all concentrates  let us not rove  let us sit at home with the cause  let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions  by a simple declaration of the divine fact  bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet  for god is here within  let our simplicity judge them  and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches but now we are a mob  man does not stand in awe of man  nor is his genius admonished to stay at home  to put itself in communication with the internal ocean  but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men  we must go alone  i like the silent church before the service begins  better than any preaching  how far off  how cool  how chaste the persons look  begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary  so let us always sit  why should we assume the faults of our friend  or wife  or father  or child  because they sit around our hearth  or are said to have the same blood  all men have my blood  and i have all men s  not for that will i adopt their petulance or folly  even to the extent of being ashamed of it  but your isolation must not be mechanical  but spiritual  that is  must be elevation  at times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles  friend  client  child  sickness  fear  want  charity  all knock at once at thy closet door  and say —  come out unto us   but keep thy state  come not into their confusion  the power men possess to annoy me  i give them by a weak curiosity  no man can come near me but through my act  what we love that we have  but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love  if we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith  let us at least resist our temptations  let us enter into the state of war  and wake thor and woden  courage and constancy  in our saxon breasts  this is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth  check this lying hospitality and lying affection  live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse  say to them  o father  o mother  o wife  o brother  o friend  i have lived with you after appearances hitherto  henceforward i am the truth s  be it known unto you that henceforward i obey no law less than the eternal law  i will have no covenants but proximities  i shall endeavour to nourish my parents  to support my family  to be the chaste husband of one wife  —but these relations i must fill after a new and unprecedented way  i appeal from your customs  i must be myself  i cannot break myself any longer for you  or you  if you can love me for what i am  we shall be the happier  if you cannot  i will still seek to deserve that you should  i will not hide my tastes or aversions  i will so trust that what is deep is holy  that i will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me  and the heart appoints  if you are noble  i will love you  if you are not  i will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions  if you are true  but not in the same truth with me  cleave to your companions  i will seek my own  i do this not selfishly  but humbly and truly  it is alike your interest  and mine  and all men s  however long we have dwelt in lies  to live in truth  does this sound harsh to day  you will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine  and  if we follow the truth  it will bring us out safe at last  —but so you may give these friends pain  yes  but i cannot sell my liberty and my power  to save their sensibility  besides  all persons have their moments of reason  when they look out into the region of absolute truth  then will they justify me  and do the same thing   the populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard  and mere antinomianism  and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes  but the law of consciousness abides  there are two confessionals  in one or the other of which we must be shriven  you may fulfil your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct  or in the reflex way  consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father  mother  cousin  neighbour  town  cat  and dog  whether any of these can upbraid you  but i may also neglect this reflex standard  and absolve me to myself  i have my own stern claims and perfect circle  it denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties  but if i can discharge its debts  it enables me to dispense with the popular code  if any one imagines that this law is lax  let him keep its commandment one day and truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity  and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster  high be his heart  faithful his will  clear his sight  that he may in good earnest be doctrine  society  law  to himself  that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others   if any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society  he will see the need of these ethics  the sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out  and we are become timorous  desponding whimperers  we are afraid o f truth  afraid of fortune  afraid of death  and afraid of each other  our age yields no great and perfect persons  we want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state  but we see that most natures are insolvent  cannot satisfy their own wants  have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force  and do lean and beg day and night continually  our housekeeping is mendicant  our arts  our occupations  our marriages  our religion  we have not chosen  but society has chosen for us  we are parlour soldiers  we shun the rugged battle of fate  where strength is born   if our young men miscarry in their first enterprises  they lose all heart  if the young merchant fails  men say he is ruined  if the finest genius studies at one of our colleges  and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of boston or new york  it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened  and in complaining the rest of his life  a sturdy lad from new hampshire or vermont  who in turn tries all the professions  who teams it  farms it  peddles  keeps a school  preaches  edits a newspaper  goes to congress  buys a township  and so forth  in successive years  and always  like a cat  falls on his feet  is worth a hundred of these city dolls  he walks abreast with his days  and feels no shame in not  studying a profession   for he does not postpone his life  but lives already  he has not one chance  but a hundred chances  let a stoic open the resources of man  and tell men they are not leaning willows  but can and must detach themselves  that with the exercise of self trust  new powers shall appear  that a man is the word made flesh  born to shed healing to the nations  that he should be ashamed of our compassion  and that the moment he acts from himself  tossing the laws  the books  idolatries  and customs out of the window  we pity him no more  but thank and revere him  —and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor  and make his name dear to all history it is easy to see that a greater self reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men  in their religion  in their education  in their pursuits  their modes of living  their association  in their property  in their speculative views   1  in what prayers do men allow themselves  that which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly  prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue  and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural  and mediatorial and miraculous  prayer that craves a particular commodity  —any thing less than all good  —is vicious  prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view  it is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul  it is the spirit of god pronouncing his works good  but prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft  it supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness  as soon as the man is at one with god  he will not beg  he will then see prayer in all action  the prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it  the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar  are true prayers heard throughout nature  though for cheap ends  caratach  in fletcher s bonduca  when admonished to inquire the mind of the god audate  replies —  his hidden meaning lies in our endeavours  br  our valors are our best gods  another sort of false prayers are our regrets  discontent is the want of self reliance  it is infirmity of will  regret calamities  if you can thereby help the sufferer  if not  attend your own work  and already the evil begins to be repaired  our sympathy is just as base  we come to them who weep foolishly  and sit down and cry for company  instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks  putting them once more in communication with their own reason  the secret of fortune is joy in our hands  welcome evermore to gods and men is the self helping man  for him all doors are flung wide  him all tongues greet  all honors crown  all eyes follow with desire  our love goes out to him and embraces him  because he did not need it  we solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him  because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation  the gods love him because men hated him  to the persevering mortal  said zoroaster  the blessed immortals are swift  as men s prayers are a disease of the will  so are their creeds a disease of the intellect  they say with those foolish israelites   let not god speak to us  lest we die  speak thou  speak any man with us  and we will obey   everywhere i am hindered of meeting god in my brother  because he has shut his own temple doors  and recites fables merely of his brother s  or his brother s brother s god  every new mind is a new classification  if it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power  a locke  a lavoisier  a hutton  a bentham  a fourier  it imposes its classification on other men  and lo  a new system  in proportion to the depth of the thought  and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil  is his complacency  but chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches  which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty  and man s relation to the highest  such is calvinism  quakerism  swedenborgism  the pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new terminology  as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby  it will happen for a time  that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master s mind  but in all unbalanced minds  the classification is idolized  passes for the end  and not for a speedily exhaustible means  so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe  the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built  they cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see  —how you can see   it must be somehow that you stole the light from us   they do not yet perceive  that light  unsystematic  indomitable  will break into any cabin  even into theirs  let them chirp awhile and call it their own  if they are honest and do well  presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low  will crack  will lean  will rot and vanish  and the immortal light  all young and joyful  million orbed  million colored  will beam over the universe as on the first morning   2  it is for want of self culture that the superstition of travelling  whose idols are italy  england  egypt  retains its fascination for all educated americans  they who made england  italy  or greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were  like an axis of the earth  in manly hours  we feel that duty is our place  the soul is no traveller  the wise man stays at home  and when his necessities  his duties  on any occasion call him from his house  or into foreign lands  he is at home still  and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance  that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue  and visits cities and men like a sovereign  and not like an interloper or a valet i have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe  for the purposes of art  of study  and benevolence  so that the man is first domesticated  or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows  he who travels to be amused  or to get somewhat which he does not carry  travels away from himself  and grows old even in youth among old things  in thebes  in palmyra  his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they  he carries ruins to ruins   travelling is a fool s paradise  our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places  at home i dream that at naples  at rome  i can be intoxicated with beauty  and lose my sadness  i pack my trunk  embrace my friends  embark on the sea  and at last wake up in naples  and there beside me is the stern fa ct  the sad self  unrelenting  identical  that i fled from  i seek the vatican  and the palaces  i affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions  but i am not intoxicated  my giant goes with me wherever i go   3  but the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action  the intellect is vagabond  and our system of education fosters restlessness  our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home  we imitate  and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind  our houses are built with foreign taste  our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments  our opinions  our tastes  our faculties  lean  and follow the past and the distant  the soul created the arts wherever they have flourished  it was in his own mind that the artist sought his model  it was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed  and why need we copy the doric or the gothic model  beauty  convenience  grandeur of thought  and quaint expression are as near to us as to any  and if the american artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him  considering the climate  the soil  the length of the day  the wants of the people  the habit and form of the government  he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted  and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also insist on yourself  never imitate  your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life s cultivation  but of the adopted talent of another  you have only an extemporaneous  half possession  that which each can do best  none but his maker can teach him  no man yet knows what it is  nor can  till that person has exhibited it  where is the master who could have taught shakspeare  where is the master who could have instructed franklin  or washington  or bacon  or newton  every great man is a unique  the scipionism of scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow  shakspeare will never be made by the study of shakspeare  do that which is assigned you  and you cannot hope too much or dare too much  there is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of phidias  or trowel of the egyptians  or the pen of moses  or dante  but different from all these  not possibly will the soul all rich  all eloquent  with thousand cloven tongue  deign to repeat itself  but if you can hear what these patriarchs say  surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice  for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature  abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life  obey thy heart  and thou shalt reproduce the foreworld again   4  as our religion  our education  our art look abroad  so does our spirit of society  all men plume themselves on the improvement of society  and no man improves society never advances  it recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other  it undergoes continual changes  it is barbarous  it is civilized  it is christianized  it is rich  it is scientific  but this change is not amelioration  for every thing that is given  something is taken  society acquires new arts  and loses old instincts  what a contrast between the well clad  reading  writing  thinking american  with a watch  a pencil  and a bill of exchange in his pocket  and the naked new zealander  whose property is a club  a spear  a mat  and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under  but compare the health of the two men  and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength  if the traveller tell us truly  strike the savage with a broad axe  and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch  and the same blow shall send the white to his grave   the civilized man has built a coach  but has lost the use of his feet  he is supported on crutches  but lacks so much support of muscle  he has a fine geneva watch  but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun  a greenwich nautical almanac he has  and so being sure of the information when he wants it  the man in the street does not know a star in the sky  the solstice he does not observe  the equinox he knows as little  and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind  his note books impair his memory  his libraries overload his wit  the insurance office increases the number of accidents  and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber  whether we have not lost by refinement some energy  by a christianity entrenched in establishments and forms  some vigor of wild virtue  for every stoic was a stoic  but in christendom where is the christian there is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk  no greater men are now than ever were  a singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages  nor can all the science  art  religion  and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than plutarch s heroes  three or four and twenty centuries ago  not in time is the race progressive  phocion  socrates  anaxagoras  diogenes  are great men  but they leave no class  he who is really of their class will not be called by their name  but will be his own man  and  in his turn  the founder of a sect  the arts and inventions of each period are only its costume  and do not invigorate men  the harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good  hudson and behring accomplished so much in their fishing boats  as to astonish parry and franklin  whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and art  galileo  with an opera glass  discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since  columbus found the new world in an undecked boat  it is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery  which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before  the great genius returns to essential man  we reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science  and yet napoleon conquered europe by the bivouac  which consisted of falling back on naked valor  and disencumbering it of all aids  the emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army  says las casas  without abolishing our arms  magazines  commissaries  and carriages  until  in imitation of the roman custom  the soldier should receive his supply of corn  grind it in his hand mill  and bake his bread himself  society is a wave  the wave moves onward  but the water of which it is composed does not  the same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge  its unity is only phenomenal  the persons who make up a nation to day  next year die  and their experience with them   and so the reliance on property  including the reliance on governments which protect it  is the want of self reliance  men have looked away from themselves and at things so long  that they have come to esteem the religious  learned  and civil institutions as guards of property  and they deprecate assaults on these  because they feel them to be assaults on property  they measure their esteem of each other by what each has  and not by what each is  but a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property  out of new respect for his nature  especially he hates what he has  if he see that it is accidental  —came to him by inheritance  or gift  or crime  then he feels that it is not having  it does not belong to him  has no root in him  and merely lies there  because no revolution or no robber takes it away  but that which a man is does always by necessity acquire  and what the man acquires is living property  which does not wait the beck of rulers  or mobs  or revolutions  or fire  or storm  or bankruptcies  but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes  thy lot or portion of life  said the caliph ali  is seeking after thee  therefore be at rest from seeking after it  our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers  the political parties meet in numerous conventions  the greater the concourse  and with each new uproar of announcement  the delegation from essex  the democrats from new hampshire  the whigs of maine  the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms  in like manner the reformers summon conventions  and vote and resolve in multitude  not so  o friends  will the god deign to enter and inhabit you  but by a method precisely the reverse  it is only as a man puts off all foreign support  and stands alone  that i see him to be strong and to prevail  he is weaker by every recruit to his banner  is not a man better than a town  ask nothing of men  and in the endless mutation  thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee  he who knows that power is inborn  that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere  and so perceiving  throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought  instantly rights himself  stands in the erect position  commands his limbs  works miracles  just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head so use all that is called fortune  most men gamble with her  and gain all  and lose all  as her wheel rolls  but do thou leave as unlawful these winnings  and deal with cause and effect  the chancellors of god  in the will work and acquire  and thou hast chained the wheel of chance  and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations  a political victory  a rise of rents  the recovery of your sick  or the return of your absent friend  or some other favorable event  raises your spirits  and you think good days are preparing for you  do not believe it  nothing can bring you peace but yourself  nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles
